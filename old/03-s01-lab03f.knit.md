### More on `aes()` - when to and when not to! {-}

The inclass activity has a short note about using the `aes()` call but we see people having issues with this so we thought a quick demonstration might help. Here is the code from the activity


```r
menrot_angle_sex <- filter(menrot, CorrectResponse == "Correct") %>%
  inner_join(demog, "Participant") %>%
  group_by(Angle, Sex) %>% 
  summarise(mean_Resp = mean(Time))
```

```
## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'Angle' (override with `.groups` argument)
```

```r
ggplot(data = menrot_angle_sex, aes(x = Angle, y = mean_Resp, group = Sex)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Sex, shape = Sex), size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 3500), expand = TRUE) +
  theme_gray()
```

</div>

Specifically, we are going to focus on the `geom_point()` line. Inside the `aes()` we stated `color = Sex, shape = Sex` and outside the `aes()` we stated, `size = 3`. Earlier we said, outside `aes()` means that all observations take the one value or color or type. Inside means that each observation within a condition takes the same value or color or type, but different conditions have different values/color/type. So based on that understanding, in the above plot, all shapes have the same size (i.e. 3), but there is a different shape and color of shape for each sex. Now let's demonstrate some alternatives.

1. All points have the same shape, color and size - nothing is in an `aes()`.
    i. here we need to state the color, shape and size we want all observations to have. We have chosen red for color (in quotes) shape style 3 (+) and size 6. We are not using a variable to split observations into groups.
    ii. we have changed the size to make the visualisation clearer


```r
ggplot(data = menrot_angle_sex, aes(x = Angle, y = mean_Resp, group = Sex)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red", shape = 3, size = 6) +
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 3500), expand = TRUE) +
  theme_bw()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="03-s01-lab03f_files/figure-html/Ch3InClassTask6-more-hidden-11-1.png" alt="All points have the same shape, color and size" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:Ch3InClassTask6-more-hidden-11)All points have the same shape, color and size</p>
</div>

2. All points have the same shape and size but color is determined by `Sex` (so goes inside the `aes()`).
    i. here we need to state the shape and size we want all dots to have. But this time we are giving the different levels within `Sex` (i.e male and female) different colors - by putting that inside the `aes()`


```r
ggplot(data = menrot_angle_sex, aes(x = Angle, y = mean_Resp, group = Sex)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Sex), shape = 3, size = 6) +
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 3500), expand = TRUE) +
  theme_bw()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="03-s01-lab03f_files/figure-html/Ch3InClassTask6-more-hidden-12-1.png" alt="All points have the same shape and size but color is determined by Sex" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:Ch3InClassTask6-more-hidden-12)All points have the same shape and size but color is determined by Sex</p>
</div>

3. We showed the code for setting color and shape by `Sex` previously. Instead now we will set the color, shape and size by the variable `Sex`. 
    i. here as all options are in the `aes()` we will have different colors, sizes, and shapes between males and females, but all males will have the same color, size and shape, and all females will have the same color size and shape.


```r
ggplot(data = menrot_angle_sex, aes(x = Angle, y = mean_Resp, group = Sex)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Sex, shape = Sex, size = Sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 3500), expand = TRUE) +
  theme_bw()
```

```
## Warning: Using size for a discrete variable is not advised.
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="03-s01-lab03f_files/figure-html/Ch3InClassTask6-more-hidden-13-1.png" alt="All points have the same shape and size but color is determined by Sex" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:Ch3InClassTask6-more-hidden-13)All points have the same shape and size but color is determined by Sex</p>
</div>

You actually get a warning when doing this option. Why? Because if you had numerous options then you would have too many different shapes being created and it would cause issue with the code and may even crash it. Pay attention to warnings.

And the reason you have to decide what is the best approach for displaying your data is because if all observations within a condition are the same, then showing them as all different colors and shapes makes very little sense. You always need to think about what you are trying to convey. Look at these two figures and think about which one is easier to understand that all observations are from the same condition. The one on the left! The one on the right suggests there is something different about all the observations.
