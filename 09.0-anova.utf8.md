# ANOVA

ANOVA stands for **AN**alysis **O**f **VA**riance. ANOVAs analyze the variation between and within groups. There are multiple types of ANOVAs based on the nature of the independent variable(s):

| **Nature of IV(s)**               | **Type of ANOVA**                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1 between-subjects IV             | One-way ANOVA                     |
| 1 within-subjects IV              | Repeated-measures ANOVA           |
| 2+ between-subjects IVs           | Independent factorial ANOVA       |
| 2+ within-subjects IVs            | Repeated measures factorial ANOVA |
| 2+ IVs mixed between/within       | Mixed factorial ANOVA             |
| 1+ IV with a continuous covariate | ANCOVA                            |

Furthermore, there are ANOVAs for when there are multiple dependent variables (called the MANOVA or **M**ultiple **ANOVA**, as well as the MANCOVA or **M**ultiple **ANCOVA**) but we will not discuss them in this class.
