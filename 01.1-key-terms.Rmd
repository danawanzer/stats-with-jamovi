This chapter will cover some basic key terms you should recall from PSYC 190. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout the semester.

### Study design terms

Some terms you should be familiar with:

-   **Between-group/subject design**: different people are in each condition; participants are only exposed to a single condition

-   **Correlational research**: a study in which causality cannot be claimed; correlation does not infer causation! It is, however, one of three necessary conditions to infer causality. It is a *necessary* but *insufficient alone* condition.

-   **Cross-sectional research**: also called non-experimental research; the IV is not manipulated and there is no random assignment. Furthermore, data is only collected at one time point (as opposed to longitudinal research)

-   **Experimental research**: the IV is manipulated and there is random assignment

-   **Falsification**: A key way we separate science from pseudo-science is that we attempt to *falsify* our hypotheses as opposed to try *verify* our hypotheses. Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is about falsifying the null hypothesis; we can never truly verify our alternative hypothesis.

-   **Hypothesis**: What we think the answer to our research question is (often our alternative hypothesis). The alternative and null hypotheses must be mutually exclusive (a result can't satisfy both) and exhaustive (all possible results are specified)

    -   **Alternative hypothesis**: Often that the IV had **an** effect on the DV; can be specified as a two-tailed (an effect) or one-tailed (greater/less than) hypothesis

    -   **Null hypothesis**: Often the *nill* hypothesis in that the IV had **no** effect on the DV

-   **Qualitative methods**: Broadly, methods that focus on words and meaning (e.g., interviews)

-   **Quantitative methods**: Broadly, methods that focus on numbers and statistics (e.g., Likert scales)

-   **Quasi-experimental research**: the IV is manipulated but there is no random assignment

-   **Randomization**: participants are randomly assigned to conditions

-   **Repeated-measures design**: participants are repeatedly measured on the dependent variable, either across conditions or across time

-   **Theory**: A description of a behavior that makes predictions about future behaviors

-   **Variation**:

    -   **Systematic**: researcher something systematically error into the study, especially into one condition over another
    -   **Unsystematic**: random variation

-   **Within-group/subject design**: the same person is in all conditions

### Variables

We tend to talk about two different types of variables in our studies:

1.  **Independent variable** (IV; also known as the predictor variable): this is the variable that is thought to be the cause of some effect. In experimental research, it is the variable that is manipulated.

2.  **Dependent variable** (DV; also known as the outcome variable): this is the variable that is thought to be affected by changes in the IV.

There are other types of variables we may be interested in:

-   **Confounding variable**: a variable that affects or is related to both the independent and dependent variable

-   **Covariate**: a variable that only affects or is only related to the dependent variable

### Levels of measurement

There are also various **levels of measurement** that we will refresh ourselves on in an upcoming week:

-   **Categorical variable**: variables that have *categories* to the levels, but cannot be analyzed with a mean because the levels are not proportionate

    -   **Nominal variable**: a categorical variable in which each level of the variable is named but there is no order to them (e.g., breeds of dogs)

        -   **Binary**, **dummy-coded**, or **dichotomous variable**: a nominal variable with only two levels (general 0 or 1)

    -   **Ordinal variable**: a categorical variable in which each level of the variable is named and there is an order to them (e.g., ranks)

-   **Continuous variable**: variables with proportionate intervals between the levels meaning they can be analyzed with a mean, SD, variance

    -   **Interval variable**: a continuous variable that has intervals that are directly proportionate (e.g., the distance between 2-3 is the same as the distance between 5-6)

    -   **Ratio variable**: a continuous variable like an internal variable but can accommodate an absolute zero, meaning a zero is actually possible (e.g., weight, temperature in Kelvin, reaction time)

### Reliability and validity

![](images/01-intro/reliability-validity.jpg)

-   **Reliability**: the consistency of a measure by time (test-retest reliability), across items (internal consistency) or across different researchers (inter-rater reliability)

-   **Validity**: the extent to which a test measures what it claims to measure

    -   **Construct validity**: validity of inferences about the higher order constructs that represent sampling particulars. There are multiple types of construct validity; here are a few:

        -   **Content validity**: experts using their judgment that something measures what it is supposed to measure
        -   **Convergent validity**: correlations among two theoretically related constructs (or measurements) are strong and positive
        -   **Divergent validity**: correlations among two theoretically not-related constructs (or measurements) are zero/null
        -   **Criterion validity**: content on one test (predictor) correlates with performance on relevant criterion measures (outcome)

    -   **Statistical validity**: validity of inferences about the correlation between treatment and outcome

    -   **Internal validity**: validity about whether the observed relationship between A and B reflects a causal relationship between A and B

    -   **External validity**: validity of inferences about whether the cause-effect relationship holds over variation in persons, places, treatment variables, and measurement variables

### Describing data

There are multiple **measures of central tendency** (these are *all* averages so you must be careful when you say that word to explain which type you mean!):

-   **Mean**: the sum of all points divided by the total number of points; susceptible to outliers

-   **Median**: the middlemost value; less susceptible to outliers and best used when the data is skewed

-   **Mode**: most frequent score

    -   **Multimodal** or **bimodal**: when two or more values are the most frequent score

There are other terms we use to describe data:

-   **Frequency distribution**: overview of the times each value occurs in a dataset; often portrayed visually like with a histogram

-   **Histogram**: a visual depiction of the frequency distribution using bars to depict a range of the distribution

-   **Kurtosis**: the weight of the tails relative to a normal distribution

    -   **Leptokurtic**: light tails; values are more concentrated around the mean

    -   **Platykurtic**: heavy tails; values are less concentrated around the mean

-   **Normal distribution**: a special distribution in which the data are symmetrical on both sides of the mean; under a normal distribution, the mean is also equal to the median

-   **Quartile**: when a dataset is divided into four equal parts, each part is a quartile (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4)

    -   **Interquartile range**: the middle 50% (Q2 to Q3)

-   **Range**: the difference between the maximum and minimum value (e.g., if the minimum score is 17 and the maximum is 49, then the range is 32)

-   **Skew**: in a non-normal distribution, it is when one tail of the distribution is longer than another. Present in asymmetric distributions

    -   **Negative skew**: when the tail points to the negative end of the spectrum; in other words, most of the values are on the right side of the distribution

    -   **Positive skew**: when the tail points to the positive end of the spectrum; in other words, most of the values are on the left side of the distribution

### Other terms

If other terms come up in the course of the semester that you believe should belong in this key term website, include it in your weekly reflection so I can update this page!
