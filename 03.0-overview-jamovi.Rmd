# Overview of jamovi

jamovi is a free and open statistical software that helps us run our descriptive and inferential statistics. Why are we using jamovi and not another program?

1.  Did I mention it's free? You won't ever have to pay a dime to use the software in the future.

2.  It's open source, meaning that the statistical community helps support and improve the program. As jamovi says, "jamovi is made by the scientific community, for the scientific community."

3.  It's built on top of the R statistical language, meaning you can begin learning how to code (if you want). I do all of my statistical analyses using R in a different program called RStudio (actually this book was developed in RStudio and hosted on GitHub!). It's a very powerful tool which is also free and open source.

4.  It's incredibly easy to learn and use. I have taught statistics using both SPSS and jamovi, and students greatly prefer jamovi.

5.  It promotes reproducibility. jamovi will save your data, analyses, options, and results all in one file so you can easily pick up where you left off. This will make your homework and future data analyses a breeze.

### Additional jamovi videos

If you would like additional videos on working with jamovi, I recommend either the [Introduction to jamovi LinkedIn Learning course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-jamovi/) by Barton Poulson, founder of [datalab.cc](https://datalab.cc/jamovi/). However, at this point the videos are a bit outdated so I am no longer assigning them. 

### Opening data in jamovi

I occasionally get questions on how to open .sav files (SPSS files) in jamovi. Here's a video walking you through that.
