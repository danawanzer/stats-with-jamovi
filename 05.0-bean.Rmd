# BEAN

What a random chapter title right? Yes, but it's also an important acronym in hypothesis testing. BEAN stands for:

1.  **B**eta (AKA power, which is technically 1 - $\beta$)
2.  **E**ffect size
3.  **A**lpha
4.  **N** (AKA sample size)

The following sections will go through each of these in turn before ending with discussion on how all of these things interrelate. Although the BEAN acronym is useful (you'll find out why in a later section), I won't discuss them in that particular order.
