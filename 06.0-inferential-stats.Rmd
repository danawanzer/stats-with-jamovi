# Inferential statistics

We've learned about hypothesis testing for inferential statistics two chapters ago and learned about some specific components of statistical testing in the last chapter. We have alluded to the fact that there are multiple inferential statistics we can perform, and that is the purpose of this chapter.

Although there are many more types, we are going to cover two basic types of inferential statistics:

1.  **Parametric statistics**, which have an assumption of normal distribution
2.  **Non-parametric statistics**, which have no assumptions about the distribution of the data
