## Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit



### Overview

The $\chi^2$ (chi-square) goodness-of-fit tests whether an observed frequency distribution of a nominal variable matches an expected frequency distribution. Our hypotheses for the chi-square goodness-of-fit test is as follows:

-   $H_0$: The observed frequencies match the expected frequencies.

-   $H_1$: At least one observed frequency doesn't match the expected frequency.

For example, if we have a deck of cards and want to see if people don't choose cards randomly, the null hypothesis would be that there is a 25% probability of getting each hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds.

### Look at the data

#### Data set-up

Our data set-up for a chi-square goodness-of-fit test is pretty simple, We just need a single column with the nominal category that each participant is in.

#### Describe your data

### Check assumptions

The chi-square goodness-of-fit test has the following assumptions:

1.  **Expected frequencies are sufficiently large**, which is usually greater than 5. If you violate this assumption, you can use Fisher's exact test.

2.  Data are independent of one another, meaning each case contributes to only one cell of the table. If you violate this assumption, you may be able to use the McNemar test.

### Perform the test

Let's run an example with data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in "lsj-data". Select and open "randomness". This dataset has participants pull two cards from a deck. For now, let's just work with `choice_1`.

1.  From the 'Analyses' toolbar select 'Frequences' - 'One sample proportion tests - N outcomes'.

2.  Move `choice_1` into the Variable box.

3.  Select `Expected counts`.

When you are done, your setup should look like this

### Interpret results

</div>

The first table shows us our observed frequencies (our data) and expected frequencies (N/k = 200/4 = 50). The second table gives us our results. Our p-value is less than .05 so we can reject the null hypothesis that the observed frequencies match our expected frequencies.

#### Write up the results in APA style

We can write up our results in APA something like this:

> Of the 200 participants in the experiment, 64 selected hearts for their first choice, 51selected diamonds, 50 selected spades, and 35 selected clubs. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test was conducted to test whether the choice probabilities were identical for all four suits. The results were statistically significant ($\chi^2$ (3) = 8.44; *p* = .038), suggesting that people did not select suits purely at random.

#### Visualize the results

### Additional information

#### Different Expected Frequencies

As you can tell, jamovi automatically assumed equal proportions of frequencies. However, perhaps we think our deck is loaded or we have the actual population frequencies and want to see if our distribution matches the population distribution. We can use the `Expected Proportions` in the setup to specify different expected frequencies.

For example, maybe we think our deck is a little stacked in favor of red cards--or we think our participants are more likely to choose red cards than black cards. We can specify our expected proportions and then interpret the results. In this case, participants do not seem more likely to choose red cards based on the expected frequencies we provided.
