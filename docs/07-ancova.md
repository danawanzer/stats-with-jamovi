Let's look at the main results next. We got three lines of results in addition to the typical residuals (error). The first two lines are our main effects of `attend` and `reading` on grades. The p-values for both are statistically significant indicating attend affects grades and reading affects grades. However, it also added an interaction term of `attend * reading`, which is not statistically significant. This means we do not have an interaction between attend and reading on grades. Interactions will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

Although we could simply look at the means to know whether attending or reading had higher grades than not attending or not reading because there are only two conditions, we can also look at the post hoc tests and definitely need to look at them if we have three or more conditions per IV. These are shown below. Because the mean differences are negative, we can determine that the second group had higher means than the second group. We can confirm that with the estimated marginal means (not shown here).

Last, we can write-up our results!

> We were interested in knowing how attendance and reading affected student grades. An independent factorial ANOVA showed that both attendance (*F* [1, 4] = 18.25, *p* = .013, $\omega^2$ = .26) and reading (*F* [1, 4] = 44.17, *p* = .003, $\omega^2$ = .64) affected student grades; there was no significant interaction between attendance and reading (*F* [1, 4] = 8.00, *p* = .660, $\omega^2$ = -.01). Post hoc comparisons using Tukey's HSD show that students who attended lectures (*M* = 75.50, *SE* = 2.98) had higher grades than students who did not (*M*Â = 57.50, *SE* = 2.98; *p* = .003, *d* = 4.70); furthermore, students who read (*M* = 80.50, *SE* = 2.98) had higher grades than students who did not (*M* = 52.50, *SE* = 2.98; *p* = .013; *d* = 3.02).
