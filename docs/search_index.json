[["writing-up-results.html", "9. Writing up results", " 9. Writing up results This chapter goes over how to write up statistical results. Refer back to this chapter often! The 4 components of writing statistical results When writing up the results of a statistical test, we should always include the following information: Description of your research question and/or hypotheses. Description of your data. If you fail to meet assumptions, you should specify that and describe what test you chose to perform as a result. The results of the inferential test, including what test was performed, the test value and degrees of freedom, p-value, and effect size. Interpretation of the results or whether the hypothesis was supported or not, including any other information as needed. An example Lets go through an example. This data comes from the independent t-test chapter. Given the results of the t-test, we can write up our results in APA something like this: The research question was whether there was a difference in student grades between Anastasias and Bernadettes classes. Anastasias students (M = 74.53, SD = 9.00, n = 15) had significantly higher grades than Bernadettes students (M = 69.06, SD = 5.77, n = 18), t (31) = 2.12, p = .043, d = .74. Lets analyze that against the 4 things we need to report: #1: The research question was whether there was a difference in student grades between Anastasias and Bernadettes classes. #4 Anastasias students #2 (M = 74.53, SD = 9.00, n = 15) #4 cont. had significantly higher grades than Bernadettes students #2 (M = 69.06, SD = 5.77, n = 18), #3 t (31) = 2.12, p = .043, d = .74. To ease the interpretation, lets write it out like this: Research question or hypothesis: Is there a difference in student grades between Anastasias and Bernadettes classes? Descriptive statistics: Anastasias students (M = 74.53, SD = 9.00, n = 15); Bernadettes students (M = 69.06, SD = 5.77, n = 18) Inferential statistics: t (31) = 2.12, p = .043, d = .74 Interpretation of results that answers the research question or demonstrates whether the hypothesis was rejected or not: Anastasias students had significantly higher grades than Bernadettes students. Sometimes, people like to put the statistics inside a parentheses. In that case, you need to change the parentheses around the degrees of freedom as brackets. Heres another example write-up of the results in APA style: #1 I tested the difference in grades between Anastasias students #2 (M = 74.53, SD = 9.00, n = 15) and Bernadettes students (M = 69.06, SD = 5.77, n = 18). #3 An independent samples t-test showed that the 5.48 mean difference between the tutors student was statistically significant (t [31] = 2.12, p = .043, d = .74). #4 Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in grades between the two classes. Note that these are not the only way we can write up the results in APA format. The key is that we include all four pieces of information as specified above. 7 Common Errors The following video details 7 common errors that folks make when reporting statistical results: Italics Decimal places Leading zero p-values Parenthesis N or n Spaces and F "]]
