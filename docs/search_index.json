[["anova.html", "Chapter 9 ANOVA", " Chapter 9 ANOVA ANOVA stands for ANalysis Of VAriance. ANOVAs analyze the variation between and within groups. There are multiple types of ANOVAs based on the nature of the independent variable(s): Nature of IV(s) Type of ANOVA 1 between-subjects IV One-way ANOVA 1 within-subjects IV Repeated-measures ANOVA 2+ between-subjects IVs Independent factorial ANOVA 2+ within-subjects IVs Repeated measures factorial ANOVA 2+ IVs mixed between/within Mixed factorial ANOVA 1+ IV with a continuous covariate ANCOVA Furthermore, there are ANOVAs for when there are multiple dependent variables (called the MANOVA or Multiple ANOVA, as well as the MANCOVA or Multiple ANCOVA) but we will not discuss them in this class. "],["one-way-anova.html", "9.1 One-way ANOVA", " 9.1 One-way ANOVA 9.1.1 Overview The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test the difference in our dependent variable between three or more different groups of observations. Our grouping variable is our independent variable. In other words, we use the one-way ANOVA when we have a research question with a continuous dependent variable and a categorical independent variable with three or more categories in which different participants are in each category. The one-way ANOVA is also known as an independent factor ANOVA. One thing to keep in mind is the one-way ANOVA is an omnibus statistic that tests against the null hypothesis that the three or more means are the same. It does not tell us where the mean differences are (e.g., that 1 &gt; 2); for that, we need planned contrasts or post-hoc procedures, which youll learn about in the next chapter. Therefore, the null and alternative hypotheses for the one-way ANOVA are as follows: \\(H_0\\): There is no difference in means between the groups. In other words, the means for the three or more groups are the same. \\(H_1\\): There is a difference in means between the groups. To find the difference, you need to conduct planned contrasts or use post-hoc procedures. 9.1.1.1 Why not multiple t-tests? Imagine we have three groups: fall, spring, and summer. We could just perform three separate t-tests: fall vs. spring, fall vs. summer, and spring vs. summer. However, the reason we do not perform multiple t-tests is because multiple t-tests means an increased Type I error rate. If I had performed three separate t-tests, set my alpha (Type I error rate) at 5% for each test, and knew for a fact the effects do not actually exist, then each test has a probability of a Type I error rate of 5%. Because we are running three tests, our alpha rate actually becomes 1 - (.953)= 1 - .857 = 14.3%! So now our familywise or experimentwise error rate is 14.3%, not the 5% we originally set alpha at. With three groups, thats not so bad, but lets see what happens with more tests we perform: 1 test: 1 - (.951)= 1 - .95 = 5% 2 tests: 1 - (.952)= 1 - .9025 = 9.8% 3 tests: 1 - (.953)= 1 - .857 = 14.3% 4 tests: 1 - (.954)= 1 - .814 = 18.6% 5 tests: 1 - (.955)= 1 - .774 = 22.6% 10 tests: 1 - (.9510)= 1 - .598 = 40.1% 20 tests: 1 - (.9520)= 1 - .358 = 64.1% Ouch! 10 tests would have a Type I error rate of 40%! That means that if we performed 10 statistical tests (assuming the effect does not exist), then 40% of the results could be statistically significant by chance alone and would be a false positive. Thats not good! Therefore, we use the one-way ANOVA as one test to see if there is a difference overall. We can also do things to control or limit our familywise error rate, which Ill get into later. 9.1.2 Specify your hypotheses For this chapter, were going to work with example data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in lsj-data. Select and open clinicaltrial (not Clinical Trial 2). This dataset is hypothetical data of a clinical trial in which you are testing a new antidepressant drug called Joyzepam. In order to construct a fair test of the drugs effectiveness, the study involves three separate drugs to be administered. One is a placebo, and the other is an existing antidepressant / anti-anxiety drug called Anxifree. A collection of 18 participants with moderate to severe depression are recruited for your initial testing. Because the drugs are sometimes administered in conjunction with psychological therapy, your study includes 9 people undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and 9 who are not. Participants are randomly assigned (doubly blinded, of course) a treatment, such that there are 3 CBT people and 3 no-therapy people assigned to each of the 3 drugs. A psychologist assesses the mood of each person after a 3 month run with each drug, and the overall improvement in each persons mood is assessed on a scale ranging from -5 to +5. Our hypotheses for the one-way ANOVA are pretty simple: \\(H_0\\): There is no difference in mood between the three drugs. \\(H_1\\): There is a difference in mood between the three drugs. However, well need the next chapter to figure out where those differences might be. 9.1.3 Look at the data 9.1.3.1 Data set-up To conduct the one-way ANOVA, we first need to ensure our data is set-up properly in our dataset. This requires having two columns: one with our continuous dependent variable and one indicating which group the participant is in. Each row is a unique participant or unit of analysis. Note that in this dataset we actually have two independent variables: drug and therapy. If we were looking at the effect of therapy on mood.gain (our DV) then we would only need to perform an independent samples t-test because there are only two groups (no.therapy and CBT). However, if we were looking at the effect of drug on mood.gain, which is our goal in this chapter, then we would perform a one-way ANOVA because there are three groups (placebo, anxifree, and joyzepam). 9.1.3.2 Describe the data Once we confirm our data is setup correctly in jamovi, we should look at our data using descriptive statistics and graphs. First, our descriptive statistics are shown below. We see that there are 18 cases in our dataset (a bit small, but lets ignore that for now) with no missing data. The mean mood gain was .88 (SD = .53) with a minimum mood gain of .10 and maximum of 1.80. Furthermore, there are 6 people in each of our three conditions in the study so we have a balanced research design. In addition, we may want to look at the distribution of mood gain across our three conditions. In the Descriptives analysis, we can choose to split by drug and then ask for a box plot with violin and data points like below. Visually, it seems like joyzepam might be leading to greater mood gain than the other two conditions, but we need to analyze it statistically to know for sure! 9.1.4 Check assumptions 9.1.4.1 Assumptions As a parametric test, the one-way ANOVA has the same assumptions as other parametric tests: The dependent variable is normally distributed Variances in the two groups are roughly equal (i.e., homogeneity of variances) The dependent variable is interval or ratio (i.e., continuous) Scores are independent between groups We cannot test the third and fourth assumptions; rather, those are based on knowing your data. However, we can and should test for the first two assumptions. Fortunately, the one-way ANOVA in jamovi has three check boxes under Assumption Checks that lets us test for both assumptions. 9.1.4.2 ANOVA is (somewhat) robust to violations Although we should meet the assumptions as much as possible, in general the F-statistic is robust to violations of normality and homogeneity of variance. This means that you can still run the one-way ANOVA if you violate the assumptions, but only when group sizes and variances are equal or nearly equal. If you have vastly different variances (such as 2:1 ratio or greater) or vastly different group sizes (such as a 2:1 ratio or greater), and especially if one group is really small (such as 10 or fewer cases), then your F-statistic is likely to be very wrong. For example, if your larger group has the larger variance, then your F-statistic is likely to be non-significant or smaller than it should be; however, if your larger group has smaller variance,then your F-statistic is likely to be significant or bigger than it should be! 9.1.4.3 Checking assumptions We test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Q-Q plot; we can also test it with skew/kurtosis and looking at the distribution of data. The Shapiro-Wilk test was not statistically significant (W = .96, p = .605); therefore, this indicates the data is normally distributed. Furthermore, the lines are fairly close to the diagonal line in the Q-Q plot. We can conclude that we satisfy the assumption of normality. We test for homogeneity of variance using the Levenes test. The Levenes test was not statistically significant (F [2, 15] = 1.45, p = .266); therefore, this indicates our data satisfies the assumption of homogeneity of variance. However, I would add a caveat that we have a small sample of data (N = 18); we should have tried to collect more data. 9.1.5 Perform the test Note: Do not use the one-way ANOVA analysis in jamovi! The options there are too limited for our use. Instead, be sure you use the ANOVA analysis!!! To perform a one-way ANOVA in jamovi, go to the Analyses tab, click the ANOVA button, and choose ANOVA. Move your dependent variable mood.gain to the Dependent Variable box and your independent variable drug to the Fixed Factors box. Select \\(\\omega^2\\) (omega-squared) for your effect size. Ignore the Model drop-down menu. If you are doing more complicated ANOVAs you will need this. We will ignore it. In the Assumption Checks drop-down menu, select all three options: Homogeneity test, Normality test, and Q-Q plot. Ignore the Contrasts and Post Hoc Tests drop-down menus for now. See the next chapter for more information. In the Estimated Marginal Means drop-down menu, move your IV drug to the Marginal Means box and select Marginal means plots, Marginal means tables, and Observed scores, in addition to the pre-selected Equal cell weights. When you are done, your setup should look like this: 9.1.6 Interpret results Once we are satisfied we have satisfied the assumptions for the one-way ANOVA, we can interpret our results. Our p-value is less than our alpha value of .05, so our results are statistically significant. 9.1.6.1 Write up the results in APA style Note: This is sufficient if your results are not statistically significant. If your F-test is statistically significant, then you also need to report the group differences as described in the next chapter! We can write up our results in APA something like this: There is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, F (2, 15) = 18.61, p &lt; .001, \\(\\omega^2\\) = .66. Sometimes, people like to put the statistics inside a parentheses. In that case, you need to change the parentheses around the degrees of freedom as brackets. Heres another example write-up of the results in APA style: There is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions (F [2, 15] = 18.61, p &lt; .001, \\(\\omega^2\\) = .66). Note: Again. this write-up is not sufficient!!! We need to add the stuff in the next chapter on group differences because our results are statistically significant. Otherwise, we could have stopped here if it was not statistically significant. 9.1.6.2 Visualize the results You should visualize the results similarly to how you visualize the results for the independent samples t-test. The default graph in the estimated marginal means output for the ANOVA is not great in my opinion. Presenting the graph of the data in this case (see the graph under Look at the Data) is probably a better option. 9.1.7 In case of violated assumptions The great news is that jamovi includes the Welchs F-statistic and the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test! The bad news is that you lose some functionality in jamovi when you use them because we use the One-Way ANOVA function instead of the ANOVA function. As always, there is also the option to transform your data or remove outliers as an option before moving to the non-parametric statistical test. Refer back to the violated assumptions section of the inferential statistics chapter to remember how to transform your data! Just like with the Welchs t-statistic (for the independent t-test), it does not have the assumption of equal variances so its appropriate to use if your data is normally distributed but does not have homogeneous variances. Similarly, the Kruskal-Wallis test is the non-parametric version of the one-way ANOVA and should be used if you do not satisfy the assumption of normality. Heres what statistic you should choose based on satisfying assumptions: Normality: satisfied Normality: not satisfied Homogeneity of Variance: satisfied one-way ANOVA (but using the ANOVA function) Kruskal-Wallis (using the one-way ANOVA function) Homogeneity of Variance: not satisfied Welchs F-test (using the one-way ANOVA function) Kruskal-Wallis (using the one-way ANOVA function) 9.1.7.1 Welchs F-test To conduct this in jamovi, you will need to use the One-Way ANOVA test, not the ANOVA test. The unfortunate thing about this test is that it strangely does not provide effect sizes. In jamovi, under Variances select Don't assume equal (Welch's). Move mood.gain to the Dependent Variable box and drug to your Grouping Variable box. You will interpret the results similarly to the one-way ANOVA: Using a Welchs F-test, there is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, F (2, 9.49) = 26.32, p &lt; .001. 9.1.7.2 Kruskal-Wallis test To perform the Kruskal-Wallis test in jamovi, you will need to select under the ANOVA button One-Way ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis towards the bottom of the list of options. Move mood.gain to the Dependent Variables box and drug to the Grouping Variable box. Select Effect size; if you need post hoc comparisons select DSCF pairwise comparisons (see section below on group differences). You will interpret the results similarly to the one-way ANOVA: Using a Kruskal-Wallis test, there is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, \\(\\chi^2\\) (2) = 12.08, p = .002, \\(\\epsilon^2\\) = .71. Notice how in this case all three results converge and show there is a statistically significant difference in the results! The problem is differences in which groups? See the next chapter! 9.1.8 Additional information 9.1.8.1 Relationship between ANOVA and t-test An ANOVA with two groups is identical to the t-test. That means the F and t statistics are directly related, and you will get the same p-value. For example, imagine you run a t-test and get a t-statistic of t (16) = -1.31, p = .210. If you ran it as a one-way ANOVA, you would get an F-statistic of F (1, 16) = 1.71, p = .210. \\(F = t^2\\) \\(t = \\sqrt{F}\\) Just a fun little bit of trivia! So if you accidentally do an F-test with two groups, no need to go back and redo the analyses (although you should if you are sharing your code for reproducibility). You can just convert your F to a t statistic easily! 9.1.8.2 A note on one-tailed vs. two-tailed tests in the ANOVA Unlike a t-test, we cant have a one-tailed test with an ANOVA. Our planned contrasts or post-hoc tests can tell us where differences are, and we can provide directional hypotheses there if we so choose. 9.1.9 Your turn!
