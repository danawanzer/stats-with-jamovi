The independent t-test is used to test the difference in our dependent variable between two different groups of observations. Our grouping variable is our independent variable. In other words, we use the independent t-test when we have a research question with a continuous dependent variable and a categorical independent variable with two categories in which different participants are in each category. The independent t-test is also the independent samples t-test and the Students t-test. I will use these terms interchangeably. 2.2 Data set-up To conduct the independent t-test, we first need to ensure our data is set-up properly in our dataset. This requires having two columns: one with our continuous dependent variable and one indicating which group the participant is in. Each row is a unique participant or unit of analysis. Heres what example data may look like if we were testing for differences in a test score by students in my fall or spring semesters of this course: Example data for the independent t-test ID Semester TestScore 1 Fall 86 2 Fall 80 3 Fall 75 4 Fall 79 5 Fall 82 6 Spring 84 7 Spring 90 8 Spring 72 9 Spring 75 10 Spring 81 In the example data above, what is your independent variable? ID Semester TestScore In the example data above, what is your dependent variable? ID Semester TestScore 2.3 The math behind the independent t-test The basic math of the independent t-test the mean difference divided by the pooled standard error. \\(t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{SE({\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2})}\\) The denominator of the equation is more difficult to calculate and depends on whether the sample size between groups is equal. 2.4 Assumptions As a parametric test, the independent t-test has the same assumptions as other parametric tests: The dependent variable is normally distributed Variances in the two groups are roughly equal (i.e., homogeneity of variances) The dependent variable is interval or ratio (i.e., continuous) Scores are independent between groups We cannot test the third and fourth assumptions; rather, those are based on knowing your data. However, we can and should test for the first two assumptions. Fortunately, the independent samples t-test in jamovi has two check boxes under Assumption Checks that lets us test for both assumptions. 2.5 In jamovi Lets run an example with data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in lsj-data. Select and open Harpo. This dataset is hypothetical data of 33 students taking Dr. Harpos statistics lectures. We have two tutors for the class, Anastasia (n = 15) and Bernadette (n = 18). Our research question is Which tutor results in better student grades? We dont have a hypothesis that one does better than the other. To perform an independent t-test in jamovi, go to the Analyses tab, click the T-Tests button, and choose Independent Samples T-Test. Move your dependent variable grade to the Dependent Variables box and your independent variable tutor to the Grouping Variable box. Under Tests, select Student's Under Hypothesis, because we have a two-sided hypothesis select a two-sided hypothesis (Group 1 does not equal Group 2). Under Additional Statistics, select Mean difference, Effect size, and Descriptives. Under Assumption Checks, select all three options: Homogeneity test, Normality test, and Q-Q plot. When you are done, your setup should look like this Figure 2.1: Independent t-test setup in jamovi 2.5.1 Checking assumptions in jamovi 2.5.1.1 Testing normality We test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Q-Q plot. The Shapiro-Wilk test was not statistically significant (W = .98, p = .827); therefore, this indicates the data is normally distributed. Furthermore, the lines are fairly close to the diagonal line in the Q-Q plot. We can conclude that we satisfy the assumption of normality. Figure 2.2: Testing normality in jamovi 2.5.1.2 Testing homogeneity of variance We test for homogeneity of variance using the Levenes test. The Levenes test was not statistically significant (F [1, 31] = 2.49, p = .125); therefore, this indicates our data satisfies the assumption of homogeneity of variance. However, I would add a caveat that we have a small sample of data (n = 15 for Anastasia and n = 18 for Bernadette) and the standard deviations are quite different from one another (SD = 9.00 vs 5.77, respectively). We should have tried to collect more data. Figure 2.3: Testing homogeneity of variance in jamovi 2.5.2 Interpreting results Once we are satisfied we have satisfied the assumptions for the independent t-test, we can interpret our results. Figure 2.4: Independent t-test results in jamovi Our p-value is less than .05, so our results are statistically significant. We can write up our results in APA something like this: Anastasias students (M = 74.53, SD = 9.00, n = 15) had significantly higher grades than Bernadettes students (M = 69.06, SD = 5.77, n = 18), t (31) = 2.12, p = .043, d = .74. Sometimes, people like to put the statistics inside a parentheses. In that case, you need to change the parentheses around the degrees of freedom as brackets. Heres another example write-up of the results in APA style: I tested the difference in grades between Anastasias students (M = 74.53, SD = 9.00, n = 15) and Bernadettes students (M = 69.06, SD = 5.77, n = 18). An independent samples t-test showed that the 5.48 mean difference between the tutors student was statistically significant (t [31] = 2.12, p = .043, d = .74). 2.6 Additional information about the independent t-test 2.6.1 Positive and negative t values Students often worry about positive or negative t-statistic values and are unsure how to interpret it. Positive or negative t-statistic values simply occur based on which group is listed first. Our t-statistic above is positive because we tested the difference between Anastasia and Bernadette: (Anastasia - Bernadette) = (74.53 - 69.06) = (5.48). However, if we flipped it and tested the difference between Bernadette and Anastasia, our mean difference would be -5.48 and our t-statistic would be -2.12. All that is to say, your positive or negative t-statistic is arbitrary. So do not fret! However, it is important the sign of your t-statistic matches what you report. For example, notice the difference: Anastasias students had higher grades than Bernadettes, t (31) = 2.12, p = .043, d = .74. Bernadettes students had lower grades than Anastasias, t (31) = -2.12, p = .043, d = .74. One last note: this positive or negative t-statistic is only relevant for the independent and dependent t-test. You will not get negative values for the F-statistic or chi-square tests! 2.6.2 What if I violated assumptions? The great news is that jamovi includes the Welchs t-statistic and the non-parametric version of the independent t-test (Mann-Whitney U)! The Welchs t-test has three main differences from the independent samples t-test: (a) the standard error (SE) is not a pooled estimate, (b) the degrees of freedom are calculated very different (not N - 2), and (c) it does not have an assumption of homogeneity of variance. The Mann-Whitney U is not calculated based on the mean but rather the median and compares ranks of values across the two groups: it has no assumptions about the distribution of data or homogeneity of variances. Heres what statistic you should choose based on satisfying assumptions: Normality: satisfied Normality: not satisfied Homogeneity of Variance: satisfied independent samples t-test Mann-Whitney U Homogeneity of Variance: not satisfied Welchs t-test Mann-Whitney U Here is what the output for all three tests look like: Figure 2.5: All independent t-test results in jamovi 2.6.2.1 Welchs t-test in jamovi To conduct this in jamovi, under Tests select Welch's. You will interpret the results similarly to the independent t-test: Using a Welchs t-test, there was not a statistically significant difference in grades between Anastasias students (M = 74.53, SD = 9.00, n = 15) and Bernadettes students (M = 69.06, SD = 5.77, n = 18), t (23.02) = 2.03, p = .054, d = .72. Why is it no longer statistically significant? Which result should you trust? In reality, the difference in p-values is likely due to chance. However, the independent t-test and Welchs test have different strengths and weaknesses. If the two populations really do have equal variances, then the independent t-test is slightly more powerful (lower Type II error rate) than the Welchs test. However, if they dont have the same variances, then the assumptions of the independent t-test are violated and you may not be able to trust the results; you may end up with a higher Type I error rate. So its a trade-off. Which should you use? I tend to prefer always using Welchs t-test because if the variances are equal, then there will be practically no difference between the independent and Welchs t-test. But if the variances are not equal, then Welchs t-test will outperform the independent t-test. For that reason, defaulting to the Welchs t-test makes most sense to me. 2.6.2.2 Mann-Whitney U test If you do not satisfy the assumption of normality (regardless of whether you satisfy the assumption of homogeneity of variance), you should either try to transform your data to be normally distributed or you will need to use a non-parametric test. In this case, if you originally wanted to perform an independent t-test, the non-parametric equivalent test is the Mann-Whitney U test. I will not go into specifics, but the idea behind the Mann-Whitney U test is that you take all the values (regardless of group) and rank them. You then sum the ranks across groups and calculate your U statistic and p-value. You interpret the p-value like you normally would, but there are differences in how we report the results because this statistic is based on the median not the mean. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, there was a statistically significant difference in grades between Anastasias students (Mdn = 76, n = 15) and Bernadettes students (Mdn = 69, n = 18), t (23.02) = 2.03, p = .054, d = .72. 2.7 Your turn!

Think critically about whether you should be using a one-tailed or two-tailed hypothesis and check your assumptions so you know which test to use! To get the most out of these exercises, try to first find out the answer on your own and then use the drop-down menus to check your answer.

The dependent t-test is used to test the difference in our dependent variable between two categories in which participants are the same across categories. Our category variable is our independent variable. In other words, we use the independent t-test when we have a research question with a continuous dependent variable and a categorical independent variable with two categories in which the same participants are in each category. The dependent t-test is also called a dependent samples t-test or paired samples t-test. 3.2 Data set-up To conduct the dependent t-test, we first need to ensure our data is set-up properly in our dataset. This requires having two columns: one is our dependent variable score for the participant in one category and the other column is our dependent variable score for the participant in the other category. Each row is a unique participant or unit of analysis. Heres what example data may look like if we were testing for differences in test scores across the same participants in the fall and spring: Example data for the dependent t-test ID TestScore_Fall TestScore_Spring 1 75 86 2 79 80 3 65 75 4 81 79 5 73 82 6 72 84 7 69 90 8 60 72 9 75 75 10 74 81 In the example data above, what is your independent variable? ID Semester TestScore In the example data above, what is your dependent variable? ID Semester Test Score 3.3 The math behind the independent t-test The basic math of the dependent t-test is the mean difference divided by the standard error, which is estimated based on the standard deviation and sample size (N). \\(t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{s_d/ \\sqrt{N}}\\) 3.4 Assumptions As a parametric test, the independent t-test has the same assumptions as other parametric tests minus the homogeneity of variance assumption because we are dealing with the same people across categories The differences in scores in the dependent variable are normally distributed The dependent variable is interval or ratio (i.e., continuous) Scores are independent across participants We cannot test the second and third assumptions; rather, those are based on knowing your data. However, we can and should test for the first assumption. Fortunately, the dependent samples t-test in jamovi has two check boxes under Assumption Checks that lets us test normality. 3.5 In jamovi Lets run an example with data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in lsj-data. Select and open Chico. This dataset is hypothetical data from Dr. Chicos class in which students took two tests: one early in the semester and one later in the semester. Dr. Chico thinks that the first test is a wake up call for students. When they realise how hard her class really is, theyll work harder for the second test and get a better mark. Is she right? Lets test it! To perform an dependent t-test in jamovi, go to the Analyses tab, click the T-Tests button, and choose Paired Samples T-Test. Move both measurements of your dependent variable (grade_test1 and grade_test2) to the Paired Variables box. Under Tests, select Student's Under Hypothesis, choose the correct hypothesis: Measure 1 is not equal to Measure 2 Measure 1 &gt; Measure 2 Measure 1 &lt; Measure 2 Under Additional Statistics, select Mean difference, Effect size, and Descriptives. Under Assumption Checks, select both options: Normality test and Q-Q plot. When you are done, your setup should look like this Figure 2.1: Dependent t-test setup in jamovi 3.5.1 Checking assumptions in jamovi 3.5.1.1 Testing normality We test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Q-Q plot. The Shapiro-Wilk test was not statistically significant (W = .97, p = .678); therefore, this indicates the data is normally distributed. Furthermore, the lines are fairly close to the diagonal line in the Q-Q plot (although its a bit hard to tell because our sample size is small). We can conclude that we satisfy the assumption of normality. Figure 2.2: Testing normality in jamovi 3.5.2 Interpreting results Once we are satisfied we have satisfied the assumptions for the dependent t-test, we can interpret our results. Figure 2.3: Dependent t-test results in jamovi Our p-value is less than .05, so our results are statistically significant. We can write up our results in APA something like this: The 20 students in Dr. Chicos class performed worse on the first test (M = 56.98, SD = 6.62) than they did on the second test (M = 58.38, SD = 6.41), t(19) = -6.48, p &lt; .001, d = -1.45. Remember in the previous chapter that our t-test can be negative but we can always flip the interpretation. Heres another example of how we could write-up our results in APA style: Dr. Chicos hypothesis was correct in that her 20 students performed better on the second test (M = 58.38, SD = 6.41) than they did on the first test (M = 56.98, SD = 6.62), t(19) = 6.48, p &lt; .001, d = 1.45. 3.6 What if I violated assumptions? If you violated the assumption of normality and no transformation fixed your data, then you can perform the non-parametric version of the dependent t-test called the Wilcoxon Rank test. As a reminder, non-parametric tests do not make assumptions about the distribution of data because it deals with the median not the mean. Here is the output for both the dependent t-test and the Wilcoxon rank test: Figure 2.4: All independent t-test results in jamovi 3.6.0.1 Wilcoxon rank in jamovi To conduct this in jamovi, under Tests select Wilcoxon rank. You will interpret the results similarly to the dependent t-test: Using Wilcoxon rank test, students test scores were significantly higher at the second test (Mdn = 59.70) than at the first test (Mdn = 57.70), W = 2.00, p &lt; .001. The note about tied values is not necessary to discuss. It is just telling us one participant had identical values for both test1 and test2 (student15). 3.7 Your turn!

Note: Technically, none of our data is suitable for a dependent t-test in this dataset. We will pretend that the four test score variables (English, Reading, Math, and Writing) are really four measurements of the same underlying test.
