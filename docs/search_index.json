[["chi-square.html", "Chapter 8 Chi-Square", " Chapter 8 Chi-Square The chi-quare is a categorical data analysis which is simply data analysis with categorical data. Its usually nominal data, although there are a couple tests we may use with ordinal data. There are two basic types of chi-square tests well be covering: \\(\\chi^2\\) goodness-of-fit: used with one variable to find if the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence (or association): used with two variables to find if the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies. In other words, are the two nominal variables independent or associated with one another? Fishers exact test: This is an alternative to the \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence that we use when our frequencies are small. McNemars test: This is an alternative to the \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence that we have a 2x2 repeated-measures design. For example, perhaps we examine pass/fail rates before and after a training. Because these tests are all with categorical data, there are no assumptions about the distribution of the data. For that reason, these are all non-parametric statistics. "],["chi-square-goodness-of-fit.html", "8.1 Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit", " 8.1 Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit 8.1.1 Overview The \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) goodness-of-fit tests whether an observed frequency distribution of a nominal variable matches an expected frequency distribution. Our hypotheses for the chi-square goodness-of-fit test is as follows: \\(H_0\\): The observed frequencies match the expected frequencies. \\(H_1\\): At least one observed frequency doesnt match the expected frequency. However, these are not how you should report your hypotheses. You should specify your hypotheses in relation to the nature of your data. For example, if we have a deck of cards and want to see if people dont choose cards randomly, the null hypothesis would be that there is a 25% probability of getting each hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds. 8.1.2 Specify the hypotheses Lets run an example with data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in lsj-data. Select and open randomness. This dataset has participants pull two cards from a deck. For now, were just going to work with choice_1. Were interested in finding out if participants pull cards randomly from the deck. \\(H_0\\): Participants pull cards randomly from the deck. In other words, there is a 25% probability of pulling each hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds. \\(H_1\\): Participants pull cards not at random from the deck. In other words, participants have a different probability than 25% of pulling at least one of the types of cards. 8.1.3 Look at the data 8.1.3.1 Data set-up Our data set-up for a chi-square goodness-of-fit test is pretty simple, We just need a single column with the nominal category that each participant is in. 8.1.3.2 Describe your data Once we confirm our data is setup correctly in jamovi, we should look at our data using descriptive statistics and graphs. First, our descriptive statistics are shown below. With nominal variables like choice_1, we should request Frequency tables, not descriptive statistics like the mean and median. The mean for choice_1 would be, quite frankly, meaningless. Whats the average card type? It cant exist. So we do frequencies instead. Notice how jamovi is pretty smart here and knows not to give us the mean, median, minimum, and maximum. Check the box for Frequency tables to receive those. From our data, we see that most participants pulled a hearts card first (n = 64, 32%) followed by diamonds (n = 51, 26%), spades (n = 50, 25%), and finally clubs (n = 35, 18%). A bar plot can visualize these descriptive statistics nicely. 8.1.4 Check assumptions The chi-square goodness-of-fit test has just one assumption: Expected frequencies are sufficiently large, which is usually greater than 5. To test this assumption, select Expected counts in jamovi. Examine the expected counts (not proportion) in the output. If all expected values are greater than 5 then you meet the assumption. 8.1.5 Perform the test To perform the chi-square goodness of fit test, do the following steps: From the Analyses toolbar select Frequences - One sample proportion tests - N outcomes. Move choice_1 into the Variable box. Select Expected counts. When you are done, your setup should look like this: 8.1.6 Interpret results The first table shows us our observed frequencies (our data) and expected frequencies (N/k = 200/4 = 50). The second table gives us our results. Our p-value is less than our alpha of .05 so we can reject the null hypothesis that the observed frequencies match our expected frequencies. 8.1.6.1 Write up the results in APA style We can write up our results in APA something like this: Of the 200 participants in the experiment, 64 selected hearts for their first choice, 51 selected diamonds, 50 selected spades, and 35 selected clubs. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test was conducted to test whether the choice probabilities were identical for all four suits. The results were statistically significant (\\(\\chi^2\\) [3] = 8.44; p = .038), suggesting that people did not select suits purely at random. Participants chose the hearts more frequently than expected and the clubs less frequently than expected. 8.1.6.2 Visualize the results The bar chart from above does a decent job of visualizing the results. Although it would be difficult to do in jamovi, we could do a revised chart in Excel pretty easily. Instead of counts, perhaps we care more about percentages, and adding a line for the expected frequency (25%). Heres an example, using instructions from this tutorial: 8.1.7 Video Heres a video walking through the chi-square goodness of fit test. 8.1.8 Additional information 8.1.8.1 Different Expected Frequencies As you can tell, jamovi automatically assumed equal proportions of frequencies. However, there might be times when you dont want to make that assumption. Maybe were testing the whether our sample frequencies match the population frequencies and those are uneven (e.g., whether our 40/60 gender split matches the 36/64 gender split in the population). We can use the Expected Proportions in the setup to specify different expected frequencies. For example, maybe we think our deck is a little stacked in favor of red cardsor we think our participants are more likely to choose red cards than black cards. We can specify our expected proportions and then interpret the results. In this case, participants do not seem more likely to choose red cards based on the expected frequencies we provided. 8.1.9 Your turn!
