The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test the difference in our dependent variable between three or more different groups of observations. Our grouping variable is our independent variable. In other words, we use the one-way ANOVA when we have a research question with a continuous dependent variable and a categorical independent variable with three or more categories in which different participants are in each category. The one-way ANOVA is also known as an independent factor ANOVA. One thing to keep in mind is the one-way ANOVA is an omnibus statistic that tests against the null hypothesis that the three or more means are the same. It does not tell us where the mean differences are (e.g., that 1 &gt; 2); for that, we need planned contrasts or post-hoc procedures, which youll learn about later. 4.2 Data set-up To conduct the independent t-test, we first need to ensure our data is set-up properly in our dataset. This requires having two columns: one with our continuous dependent variable and one indicating which group the participant is in. Each row is a unique participant or unit of analysis. Heres what example data may look like if we were testing for differences in a test score by students in my fall, spring, or summer semesters of my course Example data for the one-way ANOVA ID Semester TestScore 1 Fall 86 2 Fall 80 3 Fall 75 4 Spring 79 5 Spring 82 6 Spring 84 7 Summer 90 8 Summer 72 9 Summer 75 In the example data above, what is your independent variable? ID Semester TestScore In the example data above, what is your dependent variable? ID Semester TestScore 4.3 Why not multiple t-tests? In the example above, we have three groups: fall, spring, and summer. We could just perform three separate t-tests: fall vs. spring, fall vs. summer, and spring vs. summer. However, the reason we do not perform multiple t-tests is to reduce our Type I error rate. If I had performed three separate t-tests, set my alpha (Type I error rate) at 5%, and knew for a fact the effects do not actually exist, then each test has a probability of a Type I error rate of 5%. Because we are running three tests, our alpha rate actually becomes 1 - (.953)= 1 - .857 = 14.3%! So now our familywise or experimentwise error rate is 14.3%, not the 5% we originally set alpha at. With three groups, thats not so bad, but lets see what happens with more tests we perform: 1 test: 1 - (.951)= 1 - .95 = 5% 2 tests: 1 - (.952)= 1 - .9025 = 9.8% 3 tests: 1 - (.953)= 1 - .857 = 14.3% 4 tests: 1 - (.954)= 1 - .814 = 18.6% 5 tests: 1 - (.955)= 1 - .774 = 22.6% 10 tests: 1 - (.9510)= 1 - .598 = 40.1% 20 tests: 1 - (.9520)= 1 - .358 = 64.1% Ouch! 10 tests would have a Type I error rate of 40%! That means that if we performed 10 statistical tests (assuming the effect does not exist), then 40% of the results would be statistically significant by chance alone and would be a false positive. Thats not good! Therefore, we use the one-way ANOVA as one test to see if there is a difference overall. We can also do things to control or limit our familywise error rate, which Ill get into later. 4.4 The math behind the one-way ANOVA The basic math of the one-way ANOVA is the between-group variance (mean squares - between groups) divided by the within-group variance (mean squares - within groups). \\(F = \\frac{BG \\:variance}{WG \\:variance} = \\frac{MS_{BG}}{MS_{WG}} = \\frac{\\frac{SS_{BG}}{df_{BG}}}{\\frac{SS_{WG}}{df_{WG}}}\\) There are specific formulas for the between-group (also called the model) sum of squares (SS) and within-group (also called the residual) sum of squares. Keep in mind the following symbols: n/N = sample size (little n is per group, big N is the overall sample) k = number of groups X = mean s = standard deviation The between-group SS is the variation between group means. The calculations you see below is to subtract the overall mean (\\(\\bar{X}_{grand}\\)) from the group mean (\\(\\bar{X_k}\\)), square that mean difference, multiply that by the sample size in that group (\\(n_k\\)), and then sum all the results of doing that per group. \\(SS_{BG} = \\sum{n_k}(\\bar{X_k}-\\bar{X}_{grand})^2\\) \\(df_{BG} = k - 1\\) The within-group SS is the variation of scores within groups. The calculations you see below is to take the sample size in that group (\\(n_k\\)) and subtract 1 from it, then multiply it by the groups variance (\\(s_k^2\\), which is standard deviation squared), and then sum all the results of doing that per group. \\(SS_{WG} = \\sum{s_k^2}(n_k - 1)\\) \\(df_{WG} = N - 1\\) In other words, the F-ratio is a ratio of the group or experimental effect by the individual differences in performance. For our F-ratio to be statistically significant, we want to maximize the variance between groups (numerator) and minimize the variance within groups (denominator). 4.4.1 An example with the math In case its useful, read below. If your eyes are glazing forward, just move to the next section. You can read the example dataset below. Ive pulled the relevant data here so we can go through a hand calculation ourselves. Drug N Mean Variance Anxifree 6 0.72 .15 Joyzepam 6 1.48 .05 Placebo 6 0.45 .08 Overall 18 0.88 .28 Lets start with the easy stuff! Lets calculate our degrees of freedom. \\(df_{BG} = k - 1 = 3 -1 = 2\\) \\(df_{WG} = N - 1 = 18 - 1 = 17\\) Now lets move to the more complicated ones. \\(\\begin{aligned} SS_{BG} = \\sum{n_k}(\\bar{X_k}-\\bar{X}_{grand})^2 \\\\ SS_{BG} = 6(.72-.88)^2 + 6(1.48-.88)^2 + 6(.45-.88)^2 \\\\ SS_{BG} = 6(-.16)^2 + 6(.60)^2 + 6(-.43)^2 \\\\ SS_{BG} = 6(.0256) + 6(.36) + 6(.1849) \\\\ SS_{BG} = .1536 + 2.16 + 1.1094 \\\\ SS_{BG} = 3.423 \\end{aligned}\\) $$$$ \\begin{aligned} SS_{BG} = \\sum{n_k}(\\bar{X_k}-\\bar{X}_{grand})^2 = 6(.72-.88)^2 + 6(1.48-.88)^2 + 6 $$ 4.5 Assumptions As a parametric test, the one-way ANOVA has the same assumptions as other parametric tests: The dependent variable is normally distributed Variances in the two groups are roughly equal (i.e., homogeneity of variances) The dependent variable is interval or ratio (i.e., continuous) Scores are independent between groups We cannot test the third and fourth assumptions; rather, those are based on knowing your data. However, we can and should test for the first two assumptions. Fortunately, the one-way ANOVA in jamovi has three check boxes under Assumption Checks that lets us test for both assumptions. 4.6 In jamovi Lets run an example with data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in lsj-data. Select and open clinicaltrial. This dataset is hypothetical data of a clinical trial in which you are testing a new antidepressant drug called Joyzepam. In order to construct a fair test of the drugs effectiveness, the study involves three separate drugs to be administered. One is a placebo, and the other is an existing antidepressant / anti-anxiety drug called Anxifree. A collection of 18 participants with moderate to severe depression are recruited for your initial testing. Because the drugs are sometimes administered in conjunction with psychological therapy, your study includes 9 people undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and 9 who are not. Participants are randomly assigned (doubly blinded, of course) a treatment, such that there are 3 CBT people and 3 no-therapy people assigned to each of the 3 drugs. A psychologist assesses the mood of each person after a 3 month run with each drug, and the overall improvement in each persons mood is assessed on a scale ranging from -5 to +5. To perform a one-way ANOVA in jamovi, go to the Analyses tab, click the ANOVA button, and choose One-Way ANOVA. Move your dependent variable mood.gain to the Dependent Variables box and your independent variable drug to the Grouping Variable box. Under Variances, select Assume equal (Fisher's); well discuss later when you might select the first option. Under Additional Statistics, select Descriptives table and Descriptives plots. Under Assumption Checks, select all three options: Homogeneity test, Normality test, and Q-Q plot. When you are done, your setup should look like this (well discuss Post-Hoc Tests later): Figure 4.1: Independent t-test setup in jamovi 4.6.1 Checking assumptions in jamovi We test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Q-Q plot. The Shapiro-Wilk test was not statistically significant (W = .96, p = .605); therefore, this indicates the data is normally distributed. Furthermore, the lines are fairly close to the diagonal line in the Q-Q plot. We can conclude that we satisfy the assumption of normality. We test for homogeneity of variance using the Levenes test. The Levenes test was not statistically significant (F [2, 15] = 1.45, p = .266); therefore, this indicates our data satisfies the assumption of homogeneity of variance. However, I would add a caveat that we have a small sample of data (N = 18); we should have tried to collect more data. Figure 4.2: Testing assumptions in jamovi Figure 4.3: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! 4.7 Interpreting results Once we are satisfied we have satisfied the assumptions for the independent t-test, we can interpret our results. Figure 4.4: One-way ANOVA results in jamovi Our p-value is less than .05, so our results are statistically significant. We can write up our results in APA something like this: There is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, F (2, 15) = 18.61, p &lt; .001. Sometimes, people like to put the statistics inside a parentheses. In that case, you need to change the parentheses around the degrees of freedom as brackets. Heres another example write-up of the results in APA style: There is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions (F [2, 15] = 18.61, p &lt; .001). 4.8 What if I violated assumptions? The great news is that jamovi includes the Welchs F-statistic and the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test! Just like with the Welchs t-statistic (for the independent t-test), it does not have the assumption of equal variances so its appropriate to use if your data is normally distributed but does not have homogeneous variances. Similarly, the Kruskal-Wallis test is the non-parametric version of the one-way ANOVA and should be used if you do not satisfy the assumption of normality. Heres what statistic you should choose based on satisfying assumptions: Normality: satisfied Normality: not satisfied Homogeneity of Variance: satisfied one-way ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis Homogeneity of Variance: not satisfied Welchs F-test Kruskal-Wallis 4.8.0.1 Welchs F-test in jamovi To conduct this in jamovi, under Variances select Don't assume equal (Welch's). You will interpret the results similarly to the one-way ANOVA: Figure 4.5: One-way ANOVA results in jamovi Using a Welchs F-test, there is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, F (2, 9.49) = 26.32, p &lt; .001. 4.8.0.2 Kruskal-Wallis test in jamovi Unlike with the t-tests in which the non-parametric tests were located in the same statistical test window, you need to select under the ANOVA button One-Way ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis towards the bottom of the list of options. Move mood.gain to the Dependent Variables box and drug to the Grouping Variable box. Select Effect size. You will interpret the results similarly to the one-way ANOVA: Figure 4.6: Kruskal-Wallis results in jamovi Using a Kruskal-Wallis test, there is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, \\(\\chi^2\\) (2) = 12.08, p = .002, \\(\\epsilon^2\\) = .71. Notice how in this case all three results converge and show there is a statistically significant difference in the results! The problem is differences in which groups? 1. Post-hoc tests (both one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis) 2. Cover planned contrasts briefly 3. What about effect sizes? 4. Repeated-measures ANOVA 5. Factorial ANOVA and ANCOVA (brief here) 4.9 Your turn! Open the Sample_Dataset_2014.xlsx file that we will be using for all Your Turn exercises. Perform independent t-tests based on the following research questions. Think critically about whether you should be using a one-tailed or two-tailed hypothesis and check your assumptions so you know which test to use! To get the most out of these exercises, try to first find out the answer on your own and then use the drop-down menus to check your answer.
