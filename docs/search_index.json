The independent t-test is used to test the difference in our dependent variable between two different groups of observations. Our grouping variable is our independent variable. In other words, we use the independent t-test when we have a research question with a continuous dependent variable and a categorical independent variable with two categories in which different participants are in each category. The independent t-test is also the independent samples t-test and the Students t-test. I will use these terms interchangeably. 2.2 Data set-up To conduct the independent t-test, we first need to ensure our data is set-up properly in our dataset. This requires having two columns: one with our continuous dependent variable and one indicating which group the participant is in. Each row is a unique participant or unit of analysis. Heres what example data may look like if we were testing for differences in a test score by students in my fall or spring semesters of this course: Example data for the independent t-test ID Semester TestScore 1 Fall 86 2 Fall 80 3 Fall 75 4 Fall 79 5 Fall 82 6 Spring 84 7 Spring 90 8 Spring 72 9 Spring 75 10 Spring 81 In the example data above, what is your independent variable? ID Semester TestScore In the example data above, what is your dependent variable? ID Semester TestScore 2.3 The math behind the independent t-test The basic math of the independent t-test the mean difference divided by the pooled standard error. \\(t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{SE({\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2})}\\) The denominator of the equation is more difficult to calculate and depends on whether the sample size between groups is equal. 2.4 Assumptions As a parametric test, the independent t-test has the same assumptions as other parametric tests: The dependent variable is normally distributed Variances in the two groups are roughly equal (i.e., homogeneity of variances) The dependent variable is interval or ratio (i.e., continuous) Scores are independent between groups We cannot test the third and fourth assumptions; rather, those are based on knowing your data. However, we can and should test for the first two assumptions. Fortunately, the independent samples t-test in jamovi has two check boxes under Assumption Checks that lets us test for both assumptions. 2.5 In jamovi Lets run an example with data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in lsj-data. Select and open Harpo. This dataset is hypothetical data of 33 students taking Dr. Harpos statistics lectures. We have two tutors for the class, Anastasia (n = 15) and Bernadette (n = 18). Our research question is Which tutor results in better student grades? We dont have a hypothesis that one does better than the other. To perform an independent t-test in jamovi, go to the Analyses tab, click the T-Tests button, and choose Independent Samples T-Test. Move your dependent variable grade to the Dependent Variables box and your independent variable tutor to the Grouping Variable box. Under Tests, select Student's Under Hypothesis, because we have a two-sided hypothesis select a two-sided hypothesis (Group 1 does not equal Group 2). Under Additional Statistics, select Mean difference, Effect size, and Descriptives. Under Assumption Checks, select all three options: Homogeneity test, Normality test, and Q-Q plot. When you are done, your setup should look like this Figure 2.1: Independent t-test setup in jamovi 2.5.1 Checking assumptions in jamovi 2.5.1.1 Testing normality We test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Q-Q plot. The Shapiro-Wilk test was not statistically significant (W = .98, p = .827); therefore, this indicates the data is normally distributed. Furthermore, the lines are fairly close to the diagonal line in the Q-Q plot. We can conclude that we satisfy the assumption of normality. Figure 2.2: Testing normality in jamovi 2.5.1.2 Testing homogeneity of variance We test for homogeneity of variance using the Levenes test. The Levenes test was not statistically significant (F [1, 31] = 2.49, p = .125); therefore, this indicates our data satisfies the assumption of homogeneity of variance. However, I would add a caveat that we have a small sample of data (n = 15 for Anastasia and n = 18 for Bernadette) and the standard deviations are quite different from one another (SD = 9.00 vs 5.77, respectively). We should have tried to collect more data. Figure 2.3: Testing homogeneity of variance in jamovi 2.5.2 Interpreting results Once we are satisfied we have satisfied the assumptions for the independent t-test, we can interpret our results. Figure 2.4: Independent t-test results in jamovi Our p-value is less than .05, so our results are statistically significant. We can write up our results in APA something like this: Anastasias students (M = 74.53, SD = 9.00, n = 15) had significantly higher grades than Bernadettes students (M = 69.06, SD = 5.77, n = 18), t (31) = 2.12, p = .043, d = .74. Sometimes, people like to put the statistics inside a parentheses. In that case, you need to change the parentheses around the degrees of freedom as brackets. Heres another example write-up of the results in APA style: I tested the difference in grades between Anastasias students (M = 74.53, SD = 9.00, n = 15) and Bernadettes students (M = 69.06, SD = 5.77, n = 18). An independent samples t-test showed that the 5.48 mean difference between the tutors student was statistically significant (t [31] = 2.12, p = .043, d = .74). 2.6 Additional information about the independent t-test 2.6.1 Positive and negative t values Students often worry about positive or negative t-statistic values and are unsure how to interpret it. Positive or negative t-statistic values simply occur based on which group is listed first. Our t-statistic above is positive because we tested the difference between Anastasia and Bernadette: (Anastasia - Bernadette) = (74.53 - 69.06) = (5.48). However, if we flipped it and tested the difference between Bernadette and Anastasia, our mean difference would be -5.48 and our t-statistic would be -2.12. All that is to say, your positive or negative t-statistic is arbitrary. So do not fret! However, it is important the sign of your t-statistic matches what you report. For example, notice the difference: Anastasias students had higher grades than Bernadettes, t (31) = 2.12, p = .043, d = .74. Bernadettes students had lower grades than Anastasias, t (31) = -2.12, p = .043, d = .74. One last note: this positive or negative t-statistic is only relevant for the independent and dependent t-test. You will not get negative values for the F-statistic or chi-square tests! 2.6.2 What if I violated assumptions? The great news is that jamovi includes the Welchs t-statistic and the non-parametric version of the independent t-test (Mann-Whitney U)! The Welchs t-test has three main differences from the independent samples t-test: (a) the standard error (SE) is not a pooled estimate, (b) the degrees of freedom are calculated very different (not N - 2), and (c) it does not have an assumption of homogeneity of variance. The Mann-Whitney U is not calculated based on the mean but rather the median and compares ranks of values across the two groups: it has no assumptions about the distribution of data or homogeneity of variances. Heres what statistic you should choose based on satisfying assumptions: Normality: satisfied Normality: not satisfied Homogeneity of Variance: satisfied independent samples t-test Mann-Whitney U Homogeneity of Variance: not satisfied Welchs t-test Mann-Whitney U Here is what the output for all three tests look like: Figure 2.5: All independent t-test results in jamovi 2.6.2.1 Welchs t-test in jamovi To conduct this in jamovi, under Tests select Welch's. You will interpret the results similarly to the independent t-test: Using a Welchs t-test, there was not a statistically significant difference in grades between Anastasias students (M = 74.53, SD = 9.00, n = 15) and Bernadettes students (M = 69.06, SD = 5.77, n = 18), t (23.02) = 2.03, p = .054, d = .72. Why is it no longer statistically significant? Which result should you trust? In reality, the difference in p-values is likely due to chance. However, the independent t-test and Welchs test have different strengths and weaknesses. If the two populations really do have equal variances, then the independent t-test is slightly more powerful (lower Type II error rate) than the Welchs test. However, if they dont have the same variances, then the assumptions of the independent t-test are violated and you may not be able to trust the results; you may end up with a higher Type I error rate. So its a trade-off. Which should you use? I tend to prefer always using Welchs t-test because if the variances are equal, then there will be practically no difference between the independent and Welchs t-test. But if the variances are not equal, then Welchs t-test will outperform the independent t-test. For that reason, defaulting to the Welchs t-test makes most sense to me. 2.6.2.2 Mann-Whitney U test If you do not satisfy the assumption of normality (regardless of whether you satisfy the assumption of homogeneity of variance), you should either try to transform your data to be normally distributed or you will need to use a non-parametric test. In this case, if you originally wanted to perform an independent t-test, the non-parametric equivalent test is the Mann-Whitney U test. I will not go into specifics, but the idea behind the Mann-Whitney U test is that you take all the values (regardless of group) and rank them. You then sum the ranks across groups and calculate your U statistic and p-value. You interpret the p-value like you normally would, but there are differences in how we report the results because this statistic is based on the median not the mean. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, there was a statistically significant difference in grades between Anastasias students (Mdn = 76, n = 15) and Bernadettes students (Mdn = 69, n = 18), t (23.02) = 2.03, p = .054, d = .72. 2.7 Your turn!

The dependent t-test is used to test the difference in our dependent variable between two categories in which participants are the same across categories. Our category variable is our independent variable. In other words, we use the independent t-test when we have a research question with a continuous dependent variable and a categorical independent variable with two categories in which the same participants are in each category. The dependent t-test is also called a dependent samples t-test or paired samples t-test. 3.2 Data set-up To conduct the dependent t-test, we first need to ensure our data is set-up properly in our dataset. This requires having two columns: one is our dependent variable score for the participant in one category and the other column is our dependent variable score for the participant in the other category. Each row is a unique participant or unit of analysis.

However, we can and should test for the first assumption. Fortunately, the dependent samples t-test in jamovi has two check boxes under Assumption Checks that lets us test normality. 3.5 In jamovi Lets run an example with data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in lsj-data. Select and open Chico. This dataset is hypothetical data from Dr. Chicos class in which students took two tests: one early in the semester and one later in the semester. Dr. Chico thinks that the first test is a wake up call for students. When they realise how hard her class really is, theyll work harder for the second test and get a better mark. Is she right? Lets test it! To perform an dependent t-test in jamovi, go to the Analyses tab, click the T-Tests button, and choose Paired Samples T-Test. Move both measurements of your dependent variable (grade_test1 and grade_test2) to the Paired Variables box. Under Tests, select Student's Under Hypothesis, choose the correct hypothesis: Measure 1 is not equal to Measure 2 Measure 1 &gt; Measure 2 Measure 1 &lt; Measure 2 Under Additional Statistics, select Mean difference, Effect size, and Descriptives. Under Assumption Checks, select both options: Normality test and Q-Q plot. When you are done, your setup should look like this Figure 2.1: Dependent t-test setup in jamovi 3.5.1 Checking assumptions in jamovi 3.5.1.1 Testing normality We test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Q-Q plot. The Shapiro-Wilk test was not statistically significant (W = .97, p = .678); therefore, this indicates the data is normally distributed. Furthermore, the lines are fairly close to the diagonal line in the Q-Q plot (although its a bit hard to tell because our sample size is small). We can conclude that we satisfy the assumption of normality. Figure 2.2: Testing normality in jamovi 3.5.2 Interpreting results Once we are satisfied we have satisfied the assumptions for the dependent t-test, we can interpret our results. Figure 2.3: Dependent t-test results in jamovi Our p-value is less than .05, so our results are statistically significant. We can write up our results in APA something like this: The 20 students in Dr. Chicos class performed worse on the first test (M = 56.98, SD = 6.62) than they did on the second test (M = 58.38, SD = 6.41), t(19) = -6.48, p &lt; .001, d = -1.45. Remember in the previous chapter that our t-test can be negative but we can always flip the interpretation. Heres another example of how we could write-up our results in APA style: Dr. Chicos hypothesis was correct in that her 20 students performed better on the second test (M = 58.38, SD = 6.41) than they did on the first test (M = 56.98, SD = 6.62), t(19) = 6.48, p &lt; .001, d = 1.45. 3.6 What if I violated assumptions? If you violated the assumption of normality and no transformation fixed your data, then you can perform the non-parametric version of the dependent t-test called the Wilcoxon Rank test. As a reminder, non-parametric tests do not make assumptions about the distribution of data because it deals with the median not the mean. Here is the output for both the dependent t-test and the Wilcoxon rank test: Figure 2.4: All independent t-test results in jamovi 3.6.0.1 Wilcoxon rank in jamovi To conduct this in jamovi, under Tests select Wilcoxon rank. You will interpret the results similarly to the dependent t-test: Using Wilcoxon rank test, students test scores were significantly higher at the second test (Mdn = 59.70) than at the first test (Mdn = 57.70), W = 2.00, p &lt; .001. The note about tied values is not necessary to discuss. It is just telling us one participant had identical values for both test1 and test2 (student15). 3.7 Your turn!

The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test the difference in our dependent variable between three or more different groups of observations. Our grouping variable is our independent variable. In other words, we use the one-way ANOVA when we have a research question with a continuous dependent variable and a categorical independent variable with three or more categories in which different participants are in each category. The one-way ANOVA is also known as an independent factor ANOVA. One thing to keep in mind is the one-way ANOVA is an omnibus statistic that tests against the null hypothesis that the three or more means are the same. It does not tell us where the mean differences are (e.g., that 1 &gt; 2); for that, we need planned contrasts or post-hoc procedures, which youll learn about later. 4.2 Data set-up To conduct the one-way ANOVA, we first need to ensure our data is set-up properly in our dataset. This requires having two columns: one with our continuous dependent variable and one indicating which group the participant is in. Each row is a unique participant or unit of analysis.

ID Semester TestScore In the example data above, what is your dependent variable? ID Semester TestScore 4.3 Why not multiple t-tests? In the example above, we have three groups: fall, spring, and summer. We could just perform three separate t-tests: fall vs. spring, fall vs. summer, and spring vs. summer. However, the reason we do not perform multiple t-tests is to reduce our Type I error rate. If I had performed three separate t-tests, set my alpha (Type I error rate) at 5%, and knew for a fact the effects do not actually exist, then each test has a probability of a Type I error rate of 5%. Because we are running three tests, our alpha rate actually becomes 1 - (.953)= 1 - .857 = 14.3%! So now our familywise or experimentwise error rate is 14.3%, not the 5% we originally set alpha at. With three groups, thats not so bad, but lets see what happens with more tests we perform: 1 test: 1 - (.951)= 1 - .95 = 5% 2 tests: 1 - (.952)= 1 - .9025 = 9.8% 3 tests: 1 - (.953)= 1 - .857 = 14.3% 4 tests: 1 - (.954)= 1 - .814 = 18.6% 5 tests: 1 - (.955)= 1 - .774 = 22.6% 10 tests: 1 - (.9510)= 1 - .598 = 40.1% 20 tests: 1 - (.9520)= 1 - .358 = 64.1% Ouch! 10 tests would have a Type I error rate of 40%! That means that if we performed 10 statistical tests (assuming the effect does not exist), then 40% of the results would be statistically significant by chance alone and would be a false positive. Thats not good! Therefore, we use the one-way ANOVA as one test to see if there is a difference overall. We can also do things to control or limit our familywise error rate, which Ill get into later. 4.4 The math behind the one-way ANOVA The basic math of the one-way ANOVA is the between-group variance (mean squares - between groups) divided by the within-group variance (mean squares - within groups). \\(F = \\frac{BG \\:variance}{WG \\:variance} = \\frac{MS_{BG}}{MS_{WG}} = \\frac{\\frac{SS_{BG}}{df_{BG}}}{\\frac{SS_{WG}}{df_{WG}}}\\) There are specific formulas for the between-group (also called the model) sum of squares (SS) and within-group (also called the residual) sum of squares. Keep in mind the following symbols: n/N = sample size (little n is per group, big N is the overall sample) k = number of groups X = mean s = standard deviation The between-group SS is the variation between group means. The calculations you see below is to subtract the overall mean (\\(\\bar{X}_{grand}\\)) from the group mean (\\(\\bar{X_k}\\)), square that mean difference, multiply that by the sample size in that group (\\(n_k\\)), and then sum all the results of doing that per group. \\(SS_{BG} = \\sum{n_k}(\\bar{X_k}-\\bar{X}_{grand})^2\\) \\(df_{BG} = k - 1\\) The within-group SS is the variation of scores within groups. The calculations you see below is to take the sample size in that group (\\(n_k\\)) and subtract 1 from it, then multiply it by the groups variance (\\(s_k^2\\), which is standard deviation squared), and then sum all the results of doing that per group. \\(SS_{WG} = \\sum{s_k^2}(n_k - 1)\\) \\(df_{WG} = N - k\\) In other words, the F-ratio is a ratio of the group or experimental effect by the individual differences in performance. For our F-ratio to be statistically significant, we want to maximize the variance between groups (numerator) and minimize the variance within groups (denominator). This is depicted in the image below. On the left (a) the arrows show the differences in the group means. On the right (b) the arrows highlight the variability within each group. You want to maximize (a) and minimize (b). Figure 2.1: Graphical illustration of the one-way ANOVA 4.4.1 An example with the math In case its useful, read below. If your eyes are glazing over, just move to the next section. You can read the example dataset below. Ive pulled the relevant data here so we can go through a hand calculation ourselves.

Lets calculate our degrees of freedom. \\(df_{BG} = k - 1 = 3 -1 = 2\\) \\(df_{WG} = N - k = 18 - 3 = 15\\) Now lets move to the more complicated ones. \\(\\begin{aligned} SS_{BG} &amp;= \\sum{n_k}(\\bar{X_k}-\\bar{X}_{grand})^2 \\\\ SS_{BG} &amp;= 6(.7167-.8833)^2 + 6(1.4833-.8833)^2 + 6(.4500-.8833)^2 \\\\ SS_{BG} &amp;= 6(-.1666)^2 + 6(.6)^2 + 6(-.4333)^2 \\\\ SS_{BG} &amp;= 6(.0278) + 6(.36) + 6(.1877) \\\\ SS_{BG} &amp;= .1665 + 2.16 + 1.1262 \\\\ SS_{BG} &amp;= 3.453 \\end{aligned}\\) Then we can calculate our \\(MS_{BG}\\). \\(MS_{BG} = \\frac{SS_{BG}}{df_{BG}} = \\frac{3.453}{2} = 1.727\\) Lets move to our \\(SS_{WG}\\). \\(\\begin{aligned} SS_{WG} &amp;= \\sum{s_k^2}(n_k - 1) \\\\ SS_{WG} &amp;= .1537(6-1) + .0457(6-1) + .0790(6-1) \\\\ SS_{WG} &amp;= .1537(5) + .0457(5) + .0790(5) \\\\ SS_{WG} &amp;= .7685 + .2285 + .3950 \\\\ SS_{WG} &amp;= 1.392 \\end{aligned}\\) Now we can calculate our \\(MS_{WG}\\). \\(MS_{WG} = \\frac{SS_{WG}}{df_{WG}} = \\frac{1.392}{15} = .0928\\) Now all thats left is to calculate \\(F\\)! \\(F = \\frac{MS_{BG}}{MS_{WG}} = \\frac{1.726}{.0928} = 18.60\\) Compare to the \\(F\\), \\(df_{WG}\\), and \\(df_{BG}\\) in the output below in jamovi! Notice how close we are. Also notice how many decimals I retained throughout the analyses. I was a bit off when I first did this with only two decimals throughout. Retaining four decimals throughout got me only ~one-hundredth of a decimal off from the actual results. Neat! 4.5 Assumptions As a parametric test, the one-way ANOVA has the same assumptions as other parametric tests: The dependent variable is normally distributed Variances in the two groups are roughly equal (i.e., homogeneity of variances) The dependent variable is interval or ratio (i.e., continuous) Scores are independent between groups We cannot test the third and fourth assumptions; rather, those are based on knowing your data. However, we can and should test for the first two assumptions. Fortunately, the one-way ANOVA in jamovi has three check boxes under Assumption Checks that lets us test for both assumptions. 4.5.1 ANOVA is robust to violations Although we should meet the assumptions as much as possible, in general the F-statistic is robust to violations of normality and homogeneity of variance. This means that you can still run the one-way ANOVA if you violate the assumptions, but only when group sizes are equal or nearly equal. If you have vastly different variances (such as 2:1 ratio or greater) or vastly different group sizes (such as a 2:1 ratio or greater), and especially if one group is small (such as 10 or fewer cases), then your F-statistic is likely to be very wrong. For example, if your larger group has the larger variance, then your F-statistic is likely to be non-significant or smaller than it should be; however, if your larger group has smaller variance,then your F-statistic is likely to be significant or bigger than it should be! 4.6 In jamovi Lets run an example with data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in lsj-data. Select and open clinicaltrial. This dataset is hypothetical data of a clinical trial in which you are testing a new antidepressant drug called Joyzepam. In order to construct a fair test of the drugs effectiveness, the study involves three separate drugs to be administered. One is a placebo, and the other is an existing antidepressant / anti-anxiety drug called Anxifree. A collection of 18 participants with moderate to severe depression are recruited for your initial testing. Because the drugs are sometimes administered in conjunction with psychological therapy, your study includes 9 people undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and 9 who are not. Participants are randomly assigned (doubly blinded, of course) a treatment, such that there are 3 CBT people and 3 no-therapy people assigned to each of the 3 drugs. A psychologist assesses the mood of each person after a 3 month run with each drug, and the overall improvement in each persons mood is assessed on a scale ranging from -5 to +5. To perform a one-way ANOVA in jamovi, go to the Analyses tab, click the ANOVA button, and choose ANOVA. You might be asking why we arent choosing One-Way ANOVA and thats because the options there are too limited. Move your dependent variable mood.gain to the Dependent Variable box and your independent variable drug to the Fixed Factors box. Select \\(\\omega^2\\) for your effect size. Ignore the Model drop-down menu. If you are doing more complicated ANOVAs you will need this. We will ignore it. In the Assumption Checks drop-down menu, select all three options: Homogeneity test, Normality test, and Q-Q plot. Ignore the Contrasts and Post Hoc Tests drop-down menus for now. See below for more information on them. In the Estimated Marginal Means drop-down menu, move your IV drug to the Marginal Means box and select Marginal means plots, Marginal means tables, and Observed scores, in addition to the pre-selected Equal cell weights. When you are done, your setup should look like this: Figure 2.2: One-way ANOVA setup in jamovi 4.6.1 Checking assumptions in jamovi We test for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Q-Q plot. The Shapiro-Wilk test was not statistically significant (W = .96, p = .605); therefore, this indicates the data is normally distributed. Furthermore, the lines are fairly close to the diagonal line in the Q-Q plot. We can conclude that we satisfy the assumption of normality. We test for homogeneity of variance using the Levenes test. The Levenes test was not statistically significant (F [2, 15] = 1.45, p = .266); therefore, this indicates our data satisfies the assumption of homogeneity of variance. However, I would add a caveat that we have a small sample of data (N = 18); we should have tried to collect more data. Figure 2.3: Testing assumptions in jamovi Figure 2.4: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! 4.7 Interpreting results Once we are satisfied we have satisfied the assumptions for the one-way ANOVA, we can interpret our results. Figure 2.5: One-way ANOVA results in jamovi Our p-value is less than .05, so our results are statistically significant. We can write up our results in APA something like this: There is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, F (2, 15) = 18.61, p &lt; .001, \\(\\omega^2\\) = .66. Sometimes, people like to put the statistics inside a parentheses. In that case, you need to change the parentheses around the degrees of freedom as brackets. Heres another example write-up of the results in APA style: There is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions (F [2, 15] = 18.61, p &lt; .001, \\(\\omega^2\\) = .66). 4.7.1 A note on one-tailed vs. two-tailed tests Unlike a t-test, we would not halve the p-value in an F-ratio because it is an omnibus test. Our planned contrasts or post-hoc tests can tell us where differences are, and we can provide directional hypotheses there if we so choose. 4.8 What if I violated assumptions? The great news is that jamovi includes the Welchs F-statistic and the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test! The bad news is that you lose some functionality in jamovi when you use them. Just like with the Welchs t-statistic (for the independent t-test), it does not have the assumption of equal variances so its appropriate to use if your data is normally distributed but does not have homogeneous variances. Similarly, the Kruskal-Wallis test is the non-parametric version of the one-way ANOVA and should be used if you do not satisfy the assumption of normality. Heres what statistic you should choose based on satisfying assumptions: Normality: satisfied Normality: not satisfied Homogeneity of Variance: satisfied one-way ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis Homogeneity of Variance: not satisfied Welchs F-test Kruskal-Wallis 4.8.0.1 Welchs F-test in jamovi To conduct this in jamovi, you will need to use the One-Way ANOVA test, not the ANOVA test. The unfortunate thing about this test is that it strangely does not provide effect sizes. In jamovi, under Variances select Don't assume equal (Welch's). Move mood.gain to the Dependent Variable box and drug to your Grouping Variable box. You will interpret the results similarly to the one-way ANOVA: Figure 4.1: One-way ANOVA results in jamovi Using a Welchs F-test, there is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, F (2, 9.49) = 26.32, p &lt; .001. 4.8.0.2 Kruskal-Wallis test in jamovi To perform the Kruskal-Wallis test in jamovi, you will need to select under the ANOVA button One-Way ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis towards the bottom of the list of options. Move mood.gain to the Dependent Variables box and drug to the Grouping Variable box. Select Effect size; if you need post hoc comparisons select DSCF pairwise comparisons (see section below on group differences). You will interpret the results similarly to the one-way ANOVA: Figure 4.2: Kruskal-Wallis results in jamovi Using a Kruskal-Wallis test, there is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, \\(\\chi^2\\) (2) = 12.08, p = .002, \\(\\epsilon^2\\) = .71. Notice how in this case all three results converge and show there is a statistically significant difference in the results! The problem is differences in which groups? 4.9 Finding Group Differences Often, were not interested in just whether there is a difference (which the F-statistic can tell us), but where the differences are between groups (which the F-statistic cannot tell us). For that, we use either planned contrasts when you have specific hypotheses you want to test or post-hoc comparisons when you have no specific hypotheses. Note: You do not perform contrasts or post hoc comparisons if your overall \\(F\\) statistic is not statistically significant. You do not interpret group differences if you fail to reject the null hypothesis that there are no group differences! 4.9.1 Planned Contrasts If you have before-analysis hypotheses of group differences in your data, you will use planned contrasts. You can find the planned contrasts in the ANOVA (but not the one-way ANOVA) setup as a drop-down menu. Note that while I show all six contrasts that jamovi provides, you do not normally do multiple contrasts. These are just shown for illustrative purposes: Deviation: compares the effect of each category (except the first category) to the overall experimental effect. The order of categories is alphabetical or numerical order. Notice how anxifree is considered the first category. Figure 4.3: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! Simple: Each category is compared to the first category. The order of categories is alphabetical or numerical order. Notice how anxifree is considered the first category. Figure 4.4: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! Difference: Each category (except the first) is compared to the mean effect of all previous categories. Figure 4.5: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! Helmert: Each category (except the last) is compared to the mean effect of all subsequent categories. Figure 4.6: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! Repeated: Each category is compared to the last category. Figure 4.7: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! Polynomial: Tests trends in the data. It will examine the n-1th degree based on the number of groups. In this case, because we have 3 groups it is testing both a linear (1) and quadratic (2) trend. If we had 5 groups, it would test a linear (1), quadratic (2), cubic (3), and quartic (4) trend. Note that your factor levels must be ordinal for a polynomial contrast to make sense. Figure 4.8: CAPTION THIS FIGURE!! Test yourself! Which contrast would make most sense to test given that we want to know how our drug compares to the other two drugs? deviation simple difference helmert repeated polynomial 4.9.1.1 Writing up planned contrasts Heres some example write-ups of the above results. There is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, F (2, 15) = 18.61, p &lt; .001. Repeated contrasts showed that Joyzepam (M = 1.48, SD = .21) outperformed both Anxifree (M = .72, SD = .39; p &lt; .001) and the placebo condition (M = .45, SD = .28; p &lt; .001). (Note how this example makes no sense because our data is not ordinal) There is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, F (2, 15) = 18.61, p &lt; .001. There was not a significant linear trend across the drug conditions (p = .150). 4.9.2 Post hoc comparisons Often, we do not have any a priori (or planned) predictions or hypotheses about our group differences. In this case, we use post hoc procedures. These procedures do pairwise comparisons among all of our groups, like t-tests across each of our groups. As we noted on the first page of this handout, this can be highly problematic for our Type I error rate! Therefore, we must perform corrections to control our familywise error rate. jamovi currently supports five types of post-hoc tests; I generally only use Tukey or Bonferonni: No correction: This doesnt correct for a Type I error at all. Dont use this! I wont even show it. Its bad. Never use it. NEVER. You are warned! Tukey: This is the post hoc test I use most often. It controls the Type I error rate well, but isnt as conservative of a control as the Bonferonni. Scheffe: Honestly, Ive never used it. I am not sure how its calculated. Bonferroni: This is the most conservative test. Its good if you only have a small number of comparisons to make or if you really want to control your Type I error rate. If you have a lot of them to test , then you should use something else. Holm: Honestly, Ive never used it. I am not sure how its calculated. Games-Howell for when you have unequal variances and Tukey for when you have equal variances. They will each calculate your p-values slightly differently but in a way to control for our Type I error rate as best it can. They are interpreted very similarly, so we will proceed with the Tukeys post hoc comparisons because we satisfied the assumption of equal variances. To request post hoc tests from the one-way ANOVA, open the collapsed menu at the bottom of the setup menu. Select Tukey (equal variances under Post-Hoc Test and select Mean difference, Report significance, and Flag significant comparisons under Statistics. Optionally, you can request the Test results (t and df) although this is not necessary. Below shows the post hoc test results for our one-way ANOVA. Notice the differences in p-values across the four post hoc tests and how all other values are the same. Notice how the Bonferroni is most conservative (i.e., has the largest p-values) and the Holms is the least conservative (i.e., has the smallest p-values). Keep in mind you do not normally ask for multiple post hoc comparisons. Just pick one! Normally, I just pick Tukeys. Figure 4.9: Post hoc test results in jamovi 4.9.2.1 Writing up post hoc results The way we would write up each of the post hoc comparisons is very similar. Given that I usually use Tukey, here is a write-up for those results: There is a significant difference in mood gain across the three drug conditions, F (2, 15) = 18.61, p &lt; .001. Post hoc comparisons using Tukeys HSD revealed that our drug Joyzepam (M = 1.48, SD = .21) outperformed both Anxifree (M = .72, SD = .39; p = .002) and the placebo condition (M = .45, SD = .28; p &lt; .001); there were no differences between Anxifree and the placebo condition (p 4.9.3 Group differences with violated assumptions If you are using Welchs F-test using the One-Way ANOVA in jamovi, you should select under Post-Hoc Tests Games-Howell (unequal variances). These will be interpreted similarly to the post hoc comparisons above. If you are using the Kruskal-Wallis test, you will select the check-box for DSCF pairwise comparisons. This stands for the Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner test. All you need to know is that they, too, are interpreted similarly to the post hoc comparisons above. Unfortunately, you cannot perform contrasts with either the Welchs F-test or Kruskal-Wallis test. 4.10 Relationship between ANOVA and t-test An ANOVA with two groups is identical to the t-test. That means the F and t statistics are directly related, and you will get the same p-value. For example, imagine you run a t-test and get a t-statistic of t (16) = -1.31, p = .210. If you ran it as a one-way ANOVA, you would get an F-statistic of F (1, 16) = 1.71, p = .210. \\(F = t^2\\) \\(t = \\sqrt{F}\\) Just a fun little bit of trivia! So if you accidentally do an F-test with two groups, no need to go back and redo the analyses (although you should if you are sharing your code for reproducibility). You can just convert your F to a t statistic easily! 4.11 Tips on writing up results Writing up results in APA style is both a science and an art. Theres a science to what you need to report. For example, you always report the statistics exactly the same: F (dfWG, dfBG) = X.XX, p = .XXX. You also always report the group means (M) and standard deviations (SD), although you can report them in-text like I did above or in a descriptives table like you can ask from jamovi. However, theres also an art to it. Notice how I wrote that up in a way to summarize the findings as succinctly as possible. I could have said there was a difference between anxifree and joyzepam and a difference between joyzepam and the placebo, but thats a lot more words and isnt written in a way to focus on what Im hoping to see: that my drug joyzepam performed better than the competitor anxifree and a placebo condition. This is where you need to think creatively and be very critical in checking that what you say makes sense. Read your write-ups carefully! Have someone else read it.

The repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test the difference in our dependent variable between three or more groups of observations in which all participants participate in all groups or levels. Our grouping variable is our independent variable. In other words, we use the one-way ANOVA when we have a research question with a continuous dependent variable and a categorical independent variable with three or more categories in which the same participants are in each category. The repeated measures ANOVA is also sometimes called the one-way related ANOVA. There are two ways we could have the repeated measures ANOVA. Perhaps the same group of participants are measured in the same dependent variable at three or more time points. In this case, our independent variable is time and our dependent variable is whatever is measured at each time point. Figure 2.1: Repeated measures ANOVA by Time The other way we might have the repeated measures ANOVA is if all our participants participate in all conditions of our study. In this case, our independent variable is the treatment or condition and the dependent variable is whatever is measured in each treatment or condition. Figure 2.2: Repeated measures ANOVA by Conditions 5.2 Data set-up To conduct the repeated measures ANOVA, we first need to ensure our data is set-up properly in our dataset. This requires having two columns: one with our continuous dependent variable and one indicating which group the participant is in. Each row is a unique participant or unit of analysis. Heres what example data may look like if we were testing for differences in a test score by students in my fall, spring, or summer semesters of my course in which three participants are in each of my three courses. Example data for the repeated measures ANOVA ID Fall Spring Summer 1 86 79 90 2 80 82 72 3 75 84 75 In the example data above, what is your independent variable? ID Semester TestScore In the example data above, what is your dependent variable? ID Semester TestScore 5.3 The math behind the repeated measures ANOVA The basic math of the repeated measures ANOVA is very similar to the one-way ANOVA except that the \\(SS_{WG}\\) is partitioned into two parts. Since there are the same subjects in each group, we can remove the variability due to the individual differences between subjects from the within-groups variability. \\(F = \\frac{BG \\:variance}{WG \\:variance} = \\frac{MS_{BG}}{MS_{WG}} = \\frac{\\frac{SS_{BG}}{df_{BG}}}{\\frac{SS_{WG}}{df_{WG}}}\\) So whereas our denominator in the one-way ANOVA has \\(SS_{WG}\\), our denominator for the repeated measures ANOVA has \\(SS_{WG}-SS_{subjects}\\). You can see this in more detail in the figure below by Laerd Statistics. The one-way ANOVA (also known as the independent samples ANOVA) splits the total variability in scores by the between-group (conditions) variability and the within-groups (error) variability. The repeated measures anova takes that within-groups variability and splits out the subject variability from the error variability. Figure 2.3: Repeated measures ANOVA by Time I wont go into any more detail on the math of the repeated measures ANOVA, but you can read more on Laerd Statistics guide for the repeated measures ANOVA. 5.4 Assumptions As a parametric test, the repeated measures ANOVA has the same assumptions as other parametric tests: The dependent variable is normally distributed Variances in the two groups are roughly equal (i.e., homogeneity of variances); in repeated measures ANOVA this is called the assumption of sphericity The dependent variable is interval or ratio (i.e., continuous) Scores are independent between groups (this assumption is not relevant because all participants participate in all conditions) We cannot test the third and fourth assumptions; rather, those are based on knowing your data. However, we can and should test for the first two assumptions. Fortunately, the one-way ANOVA in jamovi has three check boxes under Assumption Checks that lets us test for both assumptions. 5.4.1 Sphericity Assumption The sphericity assumption is essentially the repeated measures ANOVA equivalent of homogeneity of variances. Sphericity means there is equality of variances of the differences between treatment levels. For example, if there are three groups, then the difference in all three pairs of differences (1-2, 1-3, 2-3) need to have approximately equal variances. You only need to care about sphericity when there are at least three conditions, which is why we did not talk about this with the dependent t-test. Fortunately, like the other assumption checks, testing for sphericity is as simple as a checkbox in jamovi. 5.5 In jamovi Lets run an example with data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in lsj-data. Select and open broca. This dataset is hypothetical data in which six patients suffering from Brocas Aphasia (a language deficit commonly experienced following a stroke) complete three word recognition tasks. On the first (speech production) task, patients were required to repeat single words read out aloud by the researcher. On the second (conceptual) task, designed to test word comprehension, patients were required to match a series of pictures with their correct name. On the third (syntax) task, designed to test knowledge of correct word order, patients were asked to reorder syntactically incorrect sentences. Each patient completed all three tasks. The order in which patients attempted the tasks was counterbalanced between participants. Each task consisted of a series of 10 attempts. The number of attempts successfully completed by each patient are provided in the dataset. To perform a one-way ANOVA in jamovi, go to the Analyses tab, click the ANOVA button, and choose Repeated Measures ANOVA. Under Repeated Measures Factors name your independent variable. In this case you can name it Task. Rename the three levels of Task: Speech, Conceptual, and Syntax. Under Repeated Measures Cells move the given variable into the correct level. For example, youll move Speech to the Speech cell. Select Generalised \\(\\eta^2\\) as your measure of effect size. In the Assumption Checks drop-down menu, select Sphericity tests. Youll note that if you violate the assumption of sphericity, there are two corrections provided. These will be discussed later. In the Post Hoc Tests drop-down menu, select Tukey. Remember that we only interpret these if the overall F is statistically significant. In the Estimated Marginal Means drop-down menu, move Task to the Marginal Means box, select Marginal means tables, and select Observed scores. When you are done, your setup should look like this: Figure 2.4: Repeated Measures ANOVA setup in jamovi Figure 2.5: Repeated Measures ANOVA setup in jamovi 5.5.1 Checking assumptions in jamovi Youll notice there are no options to check for normality in the repeated measures ANOVA in jamovi. Theres an interesting conversation on the topic in the jamovi forums. Suffice to say, its complicated and maybe someday they will implement it. For now, we just wont worry about it for the repeated measures ANOVA. So what we need to worry about is testing our assumption of sphericity. You should have checked the box Sphericity tests under the Assumption Checks drop-down menu. That produces the following output: Figure 4.1: Testing sphericity in jamovi Mauchlys test of sphericity tests the null hypothesis that the variances of the differences between the conditions are equal. Therefore, just like with our previous assumption checks, if Mauchlys test is non-significant (i.e., p &gt; .05, as is the case in this analysis) then it is reasonable to conclude that the variances of the differences are not significantly different. This means we satisfy the assumption of sphericity and can conclude that the variances of the differences are roughly equal. If Mauchlys test had been statistically significant (p &lt; .05), then we would conclude that the assumption had not been met. In this case, we should apply a correction to the F-value obtained in the repeated measures ANOVA: If the Greenhouse-Geisser value in the Tests of Sphericity table is &gt; .75 then you should use the Huynh-Feldt correction. If the Greenhouse-Geisser value is &lt; .75, then you should use the Greenhouse-Geisser correction. You can select these corrections in the Assumption Checks drop-down menu. 5.6 Interpreting results Once we are satisfied we have satisfied the assumptions for the repeated measures, we can interpret our results. Figure 4.2: One-way ANOVA results in jamovi Youll notice that jamovi provides you both a Within Subjects Effects table and Between Subjects Effects table. However, we only have a within-subjects effect (Task). Why did it give us a between-subjects table? With the repeated-measures ANOVA (which only has within-subjects IVs), this is just our \\(SS_{BG}\\). However, because we dont have one, its not calculating anything. We can ignore it. It is only useful if we are conducting a mixed factorial ANOVA with both between-subjects and within-subjects effects. Therefore, the Within Subjects Effects table is of most use to us. We can see that the overall effect of Task is statistically significant (p = .013). Therefore we can look at our Post Hoc Tests results. Figure 4.3: One-way ANOVA results in jamovi The Tukey post hoc differences show that there was a significant difference between speech and syntax (p = .011), but not between conceptual and both speech and syntax. Last, we can look at the Estimated Marginal Means - Task table to see the group means for reporting purposes. This shows us that participants recognized significantly more words in the speech task than in the syntax task. We can write this up in APA style similar to the one-way ANOVA. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed examining how three tasks affected word recognition in patients suffering from Brocas Aphasia. Task significantly affected word recall, F (2, 10) = 6.93, p = .013, \\(\\eta^2_G\\) = .41. Tukeys post hoc difference tests indicated that participants recognized significantly more words in the speech task (M = 7.17, SE = .62) than participants in the syntax task (M = 4.33, SE = .62; p = .011). There were no differences between the conceptual task (M = 6.17, SE = .62) and both the speech and syntax tasks. 5.7 What if I violated assumptions? We have already discussed what to do if you violate the assumption of sphericity above; you select one of the two sphericity corrections. If you violate the assumption of normality or if the dependent variable is ordinal, then you can use the Friedman test. You can select this using the Repeated Measures ANOVA - Friedman option under the ANOVA analysis. Friedmans test can only examine one within-subjects variable, so you will move all three conditions (Speech, Conceptual, and Syntax) to the Measures box. Select Pairwise comparisons (Durbin-Conover for post hoc comparisons and Descriptives for the Means and Medians. Optionally, you can select to plot either the Means or Medians. The Setup is shown below. Figure 4.4: Repeated Measures ANOVA setup in jamovi Once youve set-up the analysis, you can interpret the results. Overall, we continue to see a statistically significant result and that there is only a significant difference between speech and syntax. Figure 4.5: Repeated Measures ANOVA setup in jamovi We can write up the results similarly as before: Friedmans test was performed examining how three tasks affected word recognition in patients suffering from Brocas Aphasia. Task significantly affected word recall, \\(\\chi^2\\) (2) = 6.64, p = .036. Pairwise comparisons using Durbin-Conover indicated that participants recognized significantly more words in the speech task (M = 7.17, Mdn = 7.50) than participants in the syntax task (M = 4.33, Mdn = 6.50; p = .006). There were no differences between the conceptual task (M = 6.17, Mdn = 6.50) and both the speech and syntax tasks. 5.8 Tips on writing up results Writing up results in APA style is both a science and an art. Theres a science to what you need to report. For example, you always report the statistics exactly the same: F (dfWG, dfBG) = X.XX, p = .XXX. You also always report the group means (M) and standard deviations (SD), although you can report them in-text like I did above or in a descriptives table like you can ask from jamovi. However, theres also an art to it. Notice how I wrote that up in a way to summarize the findings as succinctly as possible. I could have said there was a difference between anxifree and joyzepam and a difference between joyzepam and the placebo, but thats a lot more words and isnt written in a way to focus on what Im hoping to see: that my drug joyzepam performed better than the competitor anxifree and a placebo condition.

Factorial ANOVA allows us to examine two or more independent variables (IVs) simultaneously. There are several types of factorial designs: Independent factorial design: several between-group (independent) IVs Repeated measures factorial design: several within-group (repeated-measures) IVs Mixed factorial design: some between-group and some within-group IVs Furthermore, you may read about ANOVAs referred to as one-way, two-way, three-way or greater. This simply refers to how many independent variables there are. Factorial ANOVAs are sometimes also referenced by how many groups per IV there are; for example, a 2 x 3 ANOVA is a factorial ANOVA in which the first IV has two conditions and the second IV has three conditions. You would also specify which IVs are between-group and which are within-group. For example, you might write that your design is a 2 (between-subjects: gender) x3 (within-subjects: task) mixed factorial. We wont be going into too much detail on the different factorial ANOVA designs. Instead, I will walk through illustrative cases so that if you want to apply them in the future you can mimic the procedures below. 6.2 Independent Factorial ANOVA The independent factorial ANOVA has multiple between-group IVs. Lets run an example with data from lsj-data. Open data from your Data Library in lsj-data. Select and open rtfm. This data has two IVs: attend (whether or not the student turned up to lectures) and reading (whether or not the student actually read the textbook). 1 = they did and 0 = they did not. Because we do not have a within-group IV, we will select the ANOVA analysis. Move grade to your Dependent Variable box and both attend and reading to your Fixed Factors. Select all the same options as you did for the one-way ANOVA (i.e., \\(\\omega^2\\), assumption checks, Tukeys post hoc tests for the two variables attend and reading, estimated marginal means). Lets go through the output (check that your output matches!) and then discuss how to write up the results in APA format. First, we need to check assumptions. The Levenes test and Shapiro-Wilks test are shown below. We can see that we meet the assumption of normality but fail to meet the assumption of homogeneity of variance. Unfortunately, we cannot perform a Welchs F-test with more than one independent factorial so we will note this failed assumption and move on. Figure 2.1: Assumption check results in jamovi Lets look at the main results next. We got three lines of results in addition to the typical residuals (error). The first two lines are our main effects of attend and reading on grades. The p-values for both are statistically significant indicating attend affects grades and reading affects grades. However, it also added an interaction term of attend * reading, which is not statistically significant. This means we do not have an interaction between attend and reading on grades. Interactions will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Figure 2.2: Independent factorial ANOVA results in jamovi Although we could simply look at the means to know whether attending or reading had higher grades than not attending or not reading because there are only two conditions, we can also look at the post hoc tests and definitely need to look at them if we have three or more conditions per IV. These are shown below. Because the mean differences are negative, we can determine that the second group had higher means than the second group. We can confirm that with the estimated marginal means (not shown here). Figure 2.3: Post hoc results in jamovi Last, we can write-up our results! We were interested in knowing how attendance and reading affected student grades. An independent factorial ANOVA showed that both attendance (F [1, 4] = 18.25, p = .013, \\(\\omega^2\\) = .26) and reading (F [1, 4] = 44.17, p = .003, \\(\\omega^2\\) = .64) affected student grades; there was no significant interaction between attendance and reading (F [1, 4] = 8.00, p = .660, \\(\\omega^2\\) = -.01). Post hoc comparisons using Tukeys HSD show that students who attended lectures (M = 75.50, SE = 2.98) had higher grades than students who did not (M = 57.50, SE = 2.98; p = .003, d = 4.70); furthermore, students who read (M = 80.50, SE = 2.98) had higher grades than students who did not (M = 52.50, SE = 2.98; p = .013; d = 3.02). 6.2.1 Interactions Interactions occur when the effect of one IV on the DV depends on the lvel of the other IV. If you did not want to test for interaction effects, you could remove them from the Model Terms in the Model drop-down menu. However, by default they will include them. If you have 2-3 IVs, it may be reasonable to look at these interactions. However, 3-variable interactions (e.g., IV1 * IV2 * IV3) are pushing it and 4-variable interactions are highly implausible. Be critical in which interaction terms you include! jamovi can provide a plot of your interaction, which can be helpful to help interpret your results. Below is the plot for our interaction of attendance on reading. Figure 2.4: Interaction plot in jamovi The parallel lines that are sloping upward tell me there is a significant main effect for both IVs but no interaction. How do I know that? With two variables, there are only so many interaction shapes possible. This website does a fantastic time showing you all 8 combinations of the three effects (2 main effects and 1 interaction effect). Spend some time looking through it and familiarizing yourself with the plots! 6.3 Repeated Measures Factorial ANOVA This is also sometimes called the two-way (or three-way or n-way, depending on the n of IVs you have) repeated measures ANOVA. Lets go through an example repeated measures factorial ANOVA. The dataset is courtesy of Real Statistics Using Excel. A company has created a new training program for their customer service staff. To test the effectiveness of the program they took a sample of 10 employees and assessed their performance in three areas: Product (knowledge of the companys products and services), Client (their ability to relate to the customer with politeness and empathy) and Action (their ability to take action to help the customer). They then had the same 10 employees take the training course and rated their performance after the program in the same three areas. -Real Statistics Using Excel Dataset for the repeated measures factorial ANOVA ID Pre-Product Pre-Client Pre-Action Post-Product Post-Client Post-Action 1 13 12 17 18 30 34 2 12 19 18 6 18 30 3 17 19 24 21 31 32 4 12 25 25 18 39 40 5 19 27 19 18 28 27 6 6 12 6 6 18 23 7 17 18 30 24 36 38 8 18 29 36 22 36 40 9 23 30 24 18 38 32 10 18 12 24 24 25 34 You can copy-paste the table into Microsoft Excel, save as an .xlsx or .csv file, and import into jamovi to follow-along. In jamovi, select Repeated Measures ANOVA under the ANOVA analysis option. Here are the general steps: In Repeated Measures Factors, youll need to name both factors. Rename RM Factor 1 to Time and RM Factor 2 to Area. Under Time, specify two levels: Pre and Post. Under Area, specify three levels: Product, Client, and Action. In Repeated Measures Cells, youll now have six cells with the combinations of the 6 columns you have. Drag the variable from the left into the correct cell on the right. Be careful here! For example, you need to put the Pre-Product variable into the cell Pre, Product. Name your dependent variable label Performance and select `Generalised \\(\\eta^2\\). Under Assumption Checks, select Sphericity tests Under Post Hoc Tests, move Area and Time over and select Tukey. Under Estimated Marginal Means, move Time over into Term 1, Area into Term 2, and both Time and Area into Term 3. Select plots and tables, Observed scores, and Equal cell weights. Now lets go over selected output. First, we need to check our assumption of sphericity. All the Mauchlys Ws are not statistically significant so we satisfy the assumption of sphericity and do not need to apply any sphericity corrections. Figure 2.5: Assumption testing in jamovi Next lets look at the within subjects effects table. Remember, we do not need to worry about the between subjects effects table because we do not have one; it will be used in the mixed factorial design below. Overall, we see a significant main effect of area, a significant main effect of time, and a significant interaction effect of both area and time. Neat! Figure 4.1: Repeated measures ANOVA in jamovi Next, we can look at post hoc comparisons because the main effects were all statistically significant. For area, we can see that client and action had significantly higher means than product, but there was no difference between client and action. Furthermore, post-intervention performance was significantly higher than pre-intervention. Figure 4.2: Post hoc tests in jamovi Last, lets look at the interaction to get a sense of what the interaction looks like. It appears that although there are no differences between pre- and post-intervention for product, there are significant differences from pre- to post-intervention for both client and action. To be more specific on where the statistically significant differences are, you can also ask for post hoc tests for the interaction term. This is where including a plot can be very helpful for your audience! Figure 4.3: Interaction plot in jamovi Now we have everything we need (in addition to the estimated marginal means) and can write-up our results. We tested a 2 (time: pre- and post-intervention) x 3 (area: product, client, action) repeated measures factorial design to examine how both time and area affected performance. We satisfied the assumption of sphericity for all effects. There was a significant main effect of time (F [1, 9] = 33.85, p &lt; .001, \\(\\eta^2_G\\) = .25) such that performance at post-intervention (M = 26.80, SE = 1.84) was higher than at pre-intervention (M = 19.37, SE = 1.84). There was also a significant main effect of area (F [2, 18] = 26.96, p &lt; .001, \\(\\eta^2_G\\) = .36) such that both client (M = 25.10, SE = 1.95) and action (M = 27.65, SE = 19.5) performance was higher than product performance (M = 16.50, SE = 1.95), but there was no difference between client and action performance. Lastly, there was a significant interaction between time and area such that there were no differences in product performance from pre- to post-intervention but there was for client and action performance (see Figure 1). 6.4 Mixed Factorial ANOVA Under construction.
