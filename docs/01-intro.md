## Errors and mistakes

I am human, therefore I err. If you find an error in the textbook or something you think might be a mistake, please let me know ASAP so I can update this for everyone else. Let me know which section you find the error or mistake in and what the error or mistake is. For example, if there was an error here you could say, "There was an error in 1.2 that the first sentence should really be 'To err is human.'"
