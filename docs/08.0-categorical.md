# Chi-Square



The chi-quare is a categorical data analysis which is simply data analysis with categorical data. It's usually nominal data, although there are a couple tests we may use with ordinal data. There are two basic types of chi-square tests we'll be covering:

1.  $\chi^2$ **goodness-of-fit**: used with one variable to find if the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies

2.  $\chi^2$ **test of independence (or association)**: used with two variables to find if the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies. In other words, are the two nominal variables independent or associated with one another?

    1.  **Fisher's exact test**: This is an alternative to the $\chi^2$ test of independence that we use when our frequencies are small.

    2.  **McNemar's test**: This is an alternative to the $\chi^2$ test of independence that we have a 2x2 repeated-measures design. For example, perhaps we examine pass/fail rates before and after a training.

Because these tests are all with categorical data, there are no assumptions about the distribution of the data. For that reason, these are all *non-parametric statistics*.
